If you do not have a CAS account, but do have a local account, you can still log in: When you are off campus, you will be automatically prompted to sign in and authenticate with Virginia Tech via 2-factor authentication, as long as you start your search on the library's website, or configure Google Scholar to show Get VText links. There is no need to do anything in advance to ensure access.Any current employee of the university or currently enrolled student should have access. You can verify your affiliation through OneCampus.When you search in a library database like Discovery Search, a ProQuest database, or Google Scholar and find citations that are not available as full text inside that database, you should see a Get VText button or link. The Get VText system will show what kind of access we have to the item in question: full-text, online access, print access to material in one of our libraries, or links to request a copy through Interlibrary Loan. Get VText automatically authenticates users who are off campus. Extended campus users can have print materials mailed directly to them or have portions scanned via Interlibrary Loan.Some of the links on the University Libraries databases page are accessible from any participating VIVA institutions. Most of these institutions allow walk-in business. Many provide access through the Eduroam wireless network.Connect your Google Scholar account to VT Libraries to ensure easier access to the full text of sources we license own. To do so, follow the steps below: 1. Start at scholar.google.com and click on Settings. 2. Click on "Library Links" from the selections on the left. 3. Search for Virginia Tech and then select "Virginia Tech - Get Vtext" (the one with the lowercase 't' in Vtext). Then Save.Your search results will now display Get VText links that make use of the library's subscriptions and will authenticate off campus users automatically.

Digital literacy is the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that help us deal with this complexity and participate in our digital society.People think about digital literacy in lots of different ways. We created a framework to define our approach and share it with others.Our framework represents a multilayered approach to digital literacy with learners at the center. Learners interact with core competencies like Identity & Wellbeing, Discovery, Evaluation, Ethics, Creation & Scholarship, Communication & Collaboration, and Curation. These core competencies are informed by key values like Curiosity, Reflection, Equity & Social Justice, Creativity, and Participation. Finally, all of this sits within the lens of multiple literacies including Data, Information, Media, and Invention.Want to go deeper and learn more about our framework? Check out the Digital Literacy Framework Toolkit! This toolkit includes guides, learning outcomes, example lesson plans, and more.Explore, create, and connect with others at our workshops.

All rights reserved.Spring time exterior shot of Newman Library in Blacksburg, Virginia.There are a lot of pedagogical and technical issues that make the shift from in-person to online teaching challenging, but for once, copyright is not a big additional area of worry! Most of the legal issues are the same in both contexts. If it was okay to do in class, it is often okay to do online, especially when your online access is limited to the same enrolled students.
(This document is evolving and subject to change. Last updated March 12, 2020.)If it was legal to show slide images in class, it is likely legal to show them to students via live video conferencing or in recorded videos.  This may be a surprise if you have heard that there is a big difference between class lecture slides and online conference slides – but the issue is usually less offline versus online, than a restricted versus an unrestricted audience. As long as your new course video is being shared through course websites limited to the same enrolled students, the legal issues are fairly similar.Many instructors routinely post a copy of their slides as a file for students to access after in-person course meetings, which also likely doesn’t present any new issues after online course meetings.Here, the differences between online and in-person teaching can be a bit more complex. Playing audio or video from physical media during an in-person class session is 100% legal at Virginia Tech under a provision of copyright law called the “Classroom Use Exemption.” However, that exemption doesn’t cover playing the same media online. If you can limit audio and video use for your course to relatively brief clips, you may be able to include those in lecture recordings or live-casts under the copyright provision called fair use. For media use longer than brief clips, you may need to have students independently access the content outside of your lecture videos. Some further options are outlined below.There may be some practical differences in outcomes depending on where you post new course videos – on the university’s Kaltura platform it is easy to control access at the level of individual videos. You also can post video to YouTube, and the same basic legal provsions apply even on YouTube. However, it is more likely that videos posted on YouTube may encounter some automated copyright enforcement, such as a takedown notice, or disabling of included audio or video content. These automated enforcement tools are often -incorrect- when they flag audio, video, or images included in instructional videos; they fail to account for fair use. If you encounter something like this that you believe to be in error, you can contact the University Libraries' scholarly communication team for assistance.Hopefully, by mid-semester, your students have already gotten access to all assigned reading materials. If you want to share additional readings with them as you revise instructional plans – or if you want students to share more resources with each other in an online discussion board, keep in mind some simple guidelines:Linking to publicly available online content like news websites, existing online videos, etc. is rarely a copyright issue. (Better not to link to existing content that looks obviously infringing itself – Joe Schmoe’s YouTube video of the entire “Black Panther” movie is probably not a good thing to link to. But Sara Someone’s 2-minute video of herself and her best friend talking over a few of the pivotal scenes may be fair use, and is not something you should worry about linking to.)Linking to subscription content through the University Libraries is also a great option – a lot of our subscription content will have DOIs, PURLs, or other “permalink” options, all of which should work even for off-campus users. For assistance linking to any particular library subscription content, check with Ask A Librarian or your library liaison.Making copies of new materials for students (by downloading and uploading files, or by scanning from physical documents) can present some copyright issues, but they’re not different from those involved in deciding whether to share something online with your students when you are meeting in-person. It’s better not to  make copies of entire works – but most instructors don’t do that! Copying portions of works to share with students will often be fair use.University Libraries faculty and staff members can help you understand the relevant issues. Contact the University Libraries' Scholarly Communication for more information. Where an instructor doesn’t feel comfortable relying on fair use, your library liaison may be able to suggest alternative content that is already online through library subscriptions, or publicly online content. The Library may also be able to help you seek formal copyright permissions to provide copies to students – but there may be some issues with getting permissions on short timelines.Showing an entire movie or film or musical work online may be a bit more of an issue than playing it in class – but there may be options for your students to access it independently online. The University Libraries already has quite a bit of licensed streaming video content, which you are welcome to use in your online course.We may be able to purchase streaming access for additional media, but standard commercial streaming options like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and Disney+ may sometimes be the easiest option. (For exclusive content, the commercial services may be the only option.)Contact your library liaison or Ask a Librarian for further information or assistance.Adapted from “Rapidly shifting your course from in-person to online” by Nancy Sims, University of Minnesota Libraries, and licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License.Get in touch with our scholarly communication team.University Libraries (0434)Carol M.

On February 28 the University of California announced that it was terminating all of its journal subscriptions with the scholarly publishing giant Elsevier. The news sent shock waves throughout the world of higher education—not just in America but globally. Why? Because Elsevier is the world’s largest publisher of scientific research and the University of California (UC), with its ten-campus system, is one of its largest customers. The impact on Elsevier was immediate: its parent company, RELX, saw its stock drop nearly 7 percent in the aftermath of the UC announcement—and its value still has not yet recovered.In Virginia we are paying special attention to the situation because our own research universities, including Virginia Tech, have a similar journal subscription agreement with Elsevier that is set to expire in two short years. Millions of dollars are at stake in Virginia. Globally it is in the billions.

            The Libraries provide Scholarly Communication services to empower researchers to utilize, create, and develop new modes of scholarship. Scholarly Communication is the process in which researchers create, review, and disseminate their work. Scholarly Communication in the library provides funding opportunities, workshops and events, general consulting, and more. Virginia Tech was one of the earliest players in the library publishing arena. In 1989 the Scholarly Communication Project was established in the libraries as a place to experiment with the technology to produce online scholarship in new and developing formats. Since then the libraries have continued to embrace the increasingly diverse products of research and scholarship that are more than just “paper online,” including e-journals, interactive “books,” open educational resources, and innovative online digital projects. All collaborations result in sustainable publications that are included in our preservation strategy with the MetaArchive Cooperative.
Virginia Tech Libraries announces VT Publishing. VT Publishing is the scholarly publishing hub of Virginia Tech. We are committed to increasing the visibility, reach, and impact of research produced at Virginia Tech. We publish scholarly and educational materials in multiple formats for wide dissemination and permanent preservation.

    Learning, creating, and living in our digital world can be complicated. Digital literacy is the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that help us deal with this complexity and participate in our digital society.People think about digital literacy in lots of different ways. We created a framework to define our approach and share it with others.Our framework represents a multilayered approach to digital literacy with learners at the center. Learners interact with core competencies like Identity & Wellbeing, Discovery, Evaluation, Ethics, Creation & Scholarship, Communication & Collaboration, and Curation. These core competencies are informed by key values like Curiosity, Reflection, Equity & Social Justice, Creativity, and Participation. Finally, all of this sits within the lens of multiple literacies including Data, Information, Media, and Invention.Want to go deeper and learn more about our framework? Check out the Digital Literacy Framework Toolkit! This toolkit includes guides, learning outcomes, example lesson plans, and more.Explore, create, and connect with others at our workshops. Examples of our past workshops include:Check out our Events Calendar for a full listing of upcoming events and workshops.Request a workshop or contact digilit-g@vt.edu to talk more.  Digital Literacy Student Fellows support digital literacy initiatives through self-directed projects and participation in planning for events, teaching, and outreach.

Our spaces are designed to be as open as possible, allowing folks from across the campus community to engage our services.The Project Design Studio was envisioned as a space to support student teams engaging in collaborative projects. Universities are increasingly asking their students to engage in project-based learning, develop new technologies, and become entrepreneurs. As we looked around our campus, we found that students often had a difficult time finding consistent space to engage in such endeavors. With that in mind, the University Libraries opened Project Design Studio with the following goals:Provide a consistent workspace for students engaging in collaborative work.Offer the material, monetary, and human support those students need to succeed.Help students develop the skills and mindsets necessary for successful collaboration. Build a community that supports students as they engage in the high-risk, high-reward work of creativity.Create a safe environment to engage in creative risk taking and serious play.Benefits of MembershipAs a member of the Project Design Studio, you can expect the following benefits:Trial MembershipYou qualify if you aren’t sure if the Project Design Studio is for you and would like to try it out OR you have an idea for a project but are uncertain how or whether to follow through.To join as a trial member, you will simply email or talk to the studio manager, who will schedule a time to meet with you and the PDS student liaison.

Does it cost anything?
Our services and spaces are available for everyone at no cost. For 3D printing, there is a 2,000 grams cap on how much material you can print each semester for personal projects. Academic printing is unlimited. How do I get something 3D scanned?
Make an appointment through this website.Can I 3D scan myself or another person?
Yes, we can scan human subjects but there are safety considerations. It is not recommended for people with light sensitivities, epilepsy, or similar conditions. The subject needs to be still for long periods of time and might need to stand for long periods of time. It can take multiple hours to complete these scans so please plan accordingly. If you have other questions about 3D scanning human subjects, please schedule a consultation with the Studio manager or visit the 3D Scanning Studio webpage. 
How do I submit something to be 3D printed, laser cut, or manufactured on another machine?
Bring a file of your model, design, or project on a USB drive to the studio. If you don't have a USB drive we have some you can borrow. The student worker will load your file into our queue, ask you some questions about your project, and prepare it for manufacturing. We do not accept file submissions online, remotely, or through email.What is the largest size model I can print?
Our largest FDM print bed is about 11.5 x 11.5 x 10.5 inches. Our standard FDM print volume is about 9 x 8 x 8 inches. The resin printer’s build volume is 145 × 145 × 175 mm. How many prints can I submit at once?
You can submit one file at a time. If you have multiple models that you want printed at once, combine them into one file before submitting. Be aware of scales and sizes of models combined into one file. We can't 3D print anything that needs over 500 grams of material at one time. How long does it take to print at the studio?
Depending on demand, you can expect to pick up your print between 1-3 days after submitting. When we’re busy you can expect about 1-2 weeks. Please note that these estimates are flexible and not guaranteed. For actual print time - which starts once your model is loaded onto a printer - it takes about 1-14 hours, depending on the size and design of the model.Can I use the printers on my own?
Due to safety and security concerns, only Studios staff can operate the printers, laser cutters, and other manufacturing machines.Is my project or print ready to be picked up yet?
Please stop by the Studio to ask in person about the status of your project if it's taking longer than expected to finish it. You receive an automated email when your project is completed and ready to be picked up. 
Where can I learn 3D modeling and printing?
There are loads of tutorials and accessible software out there for 3D design. Check the Prototyping Studio website for a list to get started. The Studios offer workshops on a variety of topics and technologies. Visit calendar.lib.vt.edu/events to find and register for upcoming workshops.Are there other spaces on campus that have 3D printers?
Yes, here is a list of makerspaces on campus (link). Some may not have 3D printers, some may restrict access to a certain group of people, and others may have costs attached to their services.If you have other inquiries that aren't included in this list, email us at protostudio@vt.edu or schedule a consultation through this link. Look for a topic that you feel is relevant to your question or project, then pick a date and time for your appointment.

We cannot extend bookings after they start and/or after you pick up the equipment. Can I borrow more than one of the same item?Equipment loans with more than one of the same type of item (i.e., multiple DSLR cameras, multiple laptops, multiple tablets, etc.) are considered special requests. Since our inventory is limited and we aim to serve as many people in our university community as possible, we need at least two weeks in advance to review special requests. If you would like to borrow multiple items please email us at techlending@vt.edu at least two weeks before you need to pick up the items. The email should include a description and list of the items you need as well as the reason you need more than one. Special requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis by Studios management. I stopped by to pick up the equipment I booked but it wasn’t there. Why don’t reservations guarantee the availability of that item?If the equipment you booked wasn’t there when you went to pick it up, that means someone else did not turn it back in yet. We can’t predict when or why someone has not turned in the items they borrowed. Please be patient with us. If we realize that the item you booked needs maintenance and therefore can’t be checked out to you, we will notify you of this when you come to pick the item up. We will do our best to substitute a similar item.Please note that treating our staff unkindly in person or over email may result in banning you from borrowing equipment in the future. Do you have any laptops (or other specific equipment) available?We have Dell and Mac laptops. They are very popular, high demand items so availability might be limited. Visit bookings.lib.vt.edu and choose “equipment and technology” to see the different kinds of laptops, mics, cameras, VR equipment, games, and more that we offer for lending.What is the password for the laptop I borrowed?The laptops do not need passwords. If the laptop asks you for a password, hit “enter” without typing in anything in the password field. If that doesn’t work bring the laptop back to the Lending Desk and return it to our staff for troubleshooting. After that laptop is checked back in, you can create a booking for a different laptop. Monday - Thursday: 10am - 9pmFriday: 10am - 6pmSaturday - Sunday: 12pm - 5pm The Lending Desk closes for breaks, official university closings and most holidays.  Visit the University Libraries hours page for info on closures and open hours updates.The Studios Network offers many free workshops on various technologies, including creating and devoloping media projects.

We reaffirm our solidarity in opposition to hate, racism, and violence in any form; and our commitment to create, sustain, and share inclusive ways of knowing in conscientious community with each other and all the people we serve in every space we shape, and to build and maintain enduring climates of mutual care, respect, and responsibility.Asian, Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Desi American perspectives have been marginalized. As an action towards addressing this harm, we commit to making a concerted effort to build AAPIDA perspectives into our collections and events. As a library we want to remediate the persistent lack of knowledge about AAPIDA culture and history in our country. We also commit ourselves and urge our fellow Virginia Tech community members to counter silence and report acts of discrimination to the Office of Equity and Accessibility for review. University Libraries (0434)Carol M.

All rights reserved.Welcome to the University Libraries at Virginia Tech!As Virginia Tech continues its work as a global land-grant university, the University Libraries contributes to that mission by providing the resources, expertise, and innovation needed to be an enabling partner in the creation, curation, and communication of data, scholarship, and other information resources used to create new knowledge. Contemporary research in many disciplines is computational and incorporates the bringing together of digital media and analytical tools to improve processes and outcomes. Researcher training and skills development are of cardinal concern in this emerging paradigm and are embedded increasingly in scholarly activities. The University Libraries’ strategic plan, 2020-25 is focused on this perspective in support of the university achieving its strategic goals. It charts our continued course to be more than an information resource provider, but a partner in the research and academic enterprises of our university. I invite you to explore this site and connect with us as we share the university’s mission of pushing “the boundaries of knowledge by taking a hands-on, transdisciplinary approach to preparing scholars to be leaders and problem-solvers.”Sincerely,

These accomplishments are possible through the hard work and expertise of our library employees.Throughout these pages you will find stories of unique resources for research and learning such as a series of freely downloadable medical textbooks, emerging technology for lending in our studios, and a digital timeline that documents 100 years of women at Virginia Tech. These accomplishments are certainly worth celebrating — our people behind this hard work even more so.In addition to our library employees, friends of the University Libraries are making a difference for Virginia Tech students and contribute to their success. With help from more than 60 volunteers across campus and Hokie parents, the University Libraries staged its bi-annual Cheesy Nights outside in order to safely serve grilled cheese sandwiches to our students during  finals week in December. Did you know it takes more than 170 pounds of cheese to make enough grilled cheese sandwiches for hungry Hokies during finals?Several pages in the magazine are a result of your feedback from the last issue. Many of you took the time to provide your thoughts through our feedback form. You’ll see several pages with the tab “readers request” that give you a then and now view of Newman Library through the decades and a snapshot of some of the projects being created in our prototyping studio.We encourage you to keep the conversation going!

This magazine highlights the contributions the library has made during the celebration and throughout the last 150 years. From students studying in the “Old Library,” as pictured on the cover, to students pushing boundaries in virtual environments research using our studio’s volumetric capture technology, University Libraries has evolved as the university and its needs for new information and technology resources evolved.  All of these resources are maximized thanks to the expertise of our library faculty, staff, and supporters.

While historians have long interviewed generals and diplomats, oral history also allows ordinary people, and people from marginalized communities, to place their words on the record. Narrators range from formerly enslaved Virginians interviewed in the 1930s, to whiskey distillers in the 2010s. An oral history is not just the story or interview that a narrator provides; it is also the audio file and transcript entrusted to the interviewer. Oral history projects that become rich archival collections require careful planning and execution.Oral historians often interview people on the edges of the written record. The interviewer should remain aware of how their identity, the identity of the narrator, and the academic associations of the project will create power differentials and ethical quandaries. Special Collections and University Archives does not archive exploitative or predatory interviews and projects. If you plan to work with marginalized groups, such as incarcerated people or sexual assault victims, contact the Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) before you begin your project.In partnership with the Center for Oral History, Special Collections and University Archives provides short-term loans of audio and video equipment to support oral history creation in the field. Equipment can be loaned for up to three days at a time, and includes individual audio recorders and cameras, audio and video kits (with multiple components), and accessories like scanners, mics, headphones, cables, or tripods.To view our available equipment, visit our Equipment Catalog. Descriptions include links to manuals, lists of what is included in kits or what is supplied with individual items, and our terms of service. Reserved equipment must be picked up at Special Collections and University Archives during our normal hours of operation. If you have questions about borrowing equipment or have trouble making a reservation, please contanct oralhistory@vt.edu.Further, recorders and microphones are available for checkout at the Studios Technology Lending Desk on the fourth floor of Newman Library and may also be available in your academic department.Remember to hold interviews in a comfortable and safe environment with minimal noise from air conditioning units, traffic, cell phones, and household appliances. Sound booths on the fourth floor of Newman Library are available for checkout through Studios Technology Lending Desk. Oral historians can also schedule time to record in the Media Den, located on the first floor of Newman Library, through The Athenaeum.Newman Library has several spaces with equipment to edit oral histories, including the Media Recording Studio, on the second floor, and the Media Den, on the first floor. You may also choose to edit on your own, using free software such as Audacity.Email: oralhistory@vt.eduPhone: 540-231-6442 When you support the Center, the funds will be used in a number of ways to support the work of oral history and oral historians on campus. Your gift, no matter the size can aid in the funding of student employees, transcribing, equipment, and travel to conferences and interviews. If you would like more information about how to support the Center for Oral History please contact us at oralhistory@vt.edu, or by calling 540-231-6442.University Libraries (0434)Carol M.

                video.vt.edu by Kaltura User Guides and Technical Documentation 25 Sep 2023From: The University LibrariesThe University Libraries at Virginia Tech and the Christiansburg Institute are hosting an exhibit and reception on Sept. 28 from 4 - 6 p.m. on the second floor of Newman Library. The event highlights the partnership between the Christiansburg Institute and the University Libraries to digitize 38.65 linear feet of Christiansburg Institute Museum and Archives’ collections.The unheard stories gleaned from 870 photographs, 60 slides, 15 diplomas, 48,000 typed pages, and 3,300 handwritten pages from the school's principals, teachers, and students are invaluable in spotlighting the Black Appalachian experience throughout the ages and are now available to anyone with an internet connection.The exhibit features a selection of historical materials in an interactive and informative display open to the public until Dec. 17.Join us in exploring the exhibit, hearing from the Christiansburg Institute, Inc.'s Board of Directors, and enjoy refreshments.More event information and registration can be found at https://calendar.lib.vt.edu/calendar/events/ci-exhibit.More information about the project:

All rights reserved.18 Sep 2023Blast off into space and explore the solar system through a unique virtual experience that sends users into orbit. With support of a National Science Foundation grant, a team of developers in the Applied Research in Immersive Experiences and Simulations (ARIES) program in University Libraries is using virtual reality to develop an interactive universe. In this experience, users become virtual astronauts and move through space to visit all of the celestial bodies in our solar system. 
“The purpose of this program is to create a virtual reality experience for young learners to engage with STEM content that is inclusive and comfortable in a way that allows for socially constructed learning,” said Todd Ogle,  executive director of ARIES.Instead of using virtual reality headsets, this experience utilizes handheld tablets that serve as windows into the virtual space. “When you’re wearing virtual reality goggles, you can’t engage directly with anyone else in the space with you. You can’t see them. You can’t talk directly to them in an easy or natural way. We wanted learners to be able to use normal social interaction as part of the learning experience,” Ogle said. The virtual environment consists of a 30-by-30-foot space with four devices that track the location and orientation of tablet computers used by the students. Within this virtual environment, young learners can explore the solar system in pairs or solo,  interacting with the content, the teacher, and one another while doing so.The program’s developers created an immersive experience that accurately represents how the solar system functions. This means myth-busting some popular misconceptions.“There are a lot of ideas that students have such as how big all of the planets are and how close they are to each other as well as how the moon phases truly work,” said Matthew Gallagher, computer engineering major and immersive developer on the project. Users are virtually placed in the true-to-size solar system. When accurately presented, planets are impossible to see. The sun, which only takes up two pixels on the screen, is the only object visible to the human eye. To make sense of the black void, the developers placed arrows to point to where planets would be in their orbits.After the actual scale is established, the celestial bodies are enlarged to a size more supportive of active learning. Users are then placed into different scenes, such as the phases of the moon or the mechanism behind the ocean tides, finally having an opportunity to build their own planet. “The kids love the planet-builder feature. They get to pick different attributes like whether it’s a rocky planet or a gas giant, orbit velocity, and where it is placed in our solar system,” said computer science major and immersive developer Clara McDaniel. The creation of the virtual solar system requires collaborative efforts across Virginia Tech and beyond:Working in collaboration with the principal investigators and under the supervision of Sarah Tucker, program coordinator for ARIES, a team of students from disciplines across the university developed the program, incorporating physics, instructional systems design, and art along the way:The virtual solar system is still in its developmental stages, but it is slated to be completed in the fall of 2024. Once finished, it will reside in the Science Museum of Western Virginia as an interactive exhibit.

All rights reserved.Computer engineers embed computers in other machines and systems, build networks to transfer data, and develop ways to make computers faster, smaller, and more capable. They are making computers more mobile, and incorporating computers into fabrics, clothes, and building materials. Computer engineers have the option of moving into hardware or software positions, or blending the two. Industries hiring computer engineers include financial services, computer manufacturers, chemical companies, defense contractors, consulting, transportation, manufacturing, and consumer goods. Computer engineers are equally successful in large multinational firms and small startups.Chips are ubiquitous in engineering applications, including communications, networking, automotive, industrial control, robotics, medical instrumentation, smart grid, smart home, and the Internet of Things. Chip-scale integration harnesses the advances in integrated digital and analog electronics to add even greater functionality, improve performance, minimize power consumption, and expand applications. Many chip-scale integration graduates become chip designers, working for small and large companies on chips that contain millions to billions of transistors and have architectures as complex as cities. Others become tool designers that automate, verify, and test the design and manufacturing of these chips. There are also many research opportunities in this fast-changing and impactful field.Machine learning is the art of teaching computer systems how to learn on their own. Machine learning techniques are being rapidly integrated into a growing number of fields, including selfdriving cars, speech and visual recognition, effective web search, marketing, and understanding of the human genome. Career opportunities in machine learning  include software engineers, data scientists, and machine learning or computer vision engineers.Controls, robotics and autonomy goes above and beyond robots— it seeks new ways to interact with the world, interpret information, regulate processes, and teach systems how to make autonomous decisions. Engineers in this field work on aerial vehicles, vehicular networks, deep learning in robotics, autonomous decision making, autonomous teams and swarms, human-robot interaction, and other projects. Machine learning, optimization, embedded systems, and signals and systems are all important for this field. Typical career paths include control/automation engineers and robotics engineers. Advanced degrees are common for many robotics/autonomy startups and specific thrusts in larger corporationsNetworking and cybersecurity is the backbone of today’s IT industry, which is in turn a main driving force for economic growth. There is a serious shortage of graduates with these skills. Computer engineers in this field draw on hardware and software skills to ensure the efficient and safe transmission of data and energy through networks such as wireless cellular and the power grid. Stateof-the-art work in the field includes network and information security, cryptography, social networks, reliability, capacity, energy efficiency, and resilience. Large and small companies, government agencies, universities, and research institutions seek cybersecurity graduates.Software systems engineers write complex software systems of all sizes for applications including machine learning, cyber physical systems, and infrastructure software. This means they need to be confident and comfortable with hardware/software interactions and equipped with a ready knowledge of how hardware features can be exploited for designing and implementing software. Career possibilities include working as software engineers or architects, or in other jobs with a large programming component.The imagination of electrical engineers has transformed the world. EEs develop the tools and techniques to sense, measure, convert, transmit, control, and receive energy and intelligence.

Important information is disseminated at the meeting and any changes in policy are discussed, as well as the discussion of duties and assignments of various assistantship positions.All graduate students should obtain a university e-mail account (PID) through Hokie Spa and provide the Graduate Counselor with an e-mail id no later than the ECE Advisement Orientation Session. Many departmental announcements are made via e-mail, such as seminar notices. E-mail should be checked daily in order to receive these announcements for ECE graduate students in a timely manner. E-mail may be read from computers in the university computer labs as well as several sites within the department. Students are responsible for receiving all departmental information distributed by e-mail.Graduate students may also obtain an ECE Computer Workstation account once their Virginia Tech PID is set up. The workstations offer many computational tools for graduate students that may be used in their classes or research.The ECE Department provides desks, in Whittemore Hall, Durham Hall, Torgersen Hall, and other locations, for as many students as resources permit. GTAs may use, on a shared basis, desks in several rooms which are dedicated for that purpose. Alternatively, those GTAs who have teaching responsibilities in our various laboratories may use desks in those labs if desks are available. Except for the dedicated GTA desks, all other student study desks are reserved for GRA use and are under the control of laboratory, center, or research group directors. Any student seeking use of a desk should see his or her advisor for further information.All desk assignments are considered to be temporary and are reviewed for continuation at least annually. All graduate student offices are to remain locked at all times. Food products (other than packaged snack-type items) are not to be left in any graduate student office. No use of any tobacco product is permitted anywhere in Whittemore Hall, Durham Hall, or Torgersen Hall.The research professor responsible for lab and office use must approve all keys and access codes for graduate students. Any lost or misplaced keys must be reported to the ECE Facilities Coordinator immediately. Based on the facts of the case, authorization of replacement of the key may be granted, but such replacement is not automatic.Access Codes for buildings must be obtained from the faculty advisor or interim faculty advisor. The lock combinations are changed periodically and students must acquire new access codes when this occurs. Keys for access to the outside doors are not issued to students.Students must return keys to the ECE Facilities Coordinator upon completion of degree, departure from the university, or departure from a given office. Failure to return keys to the ECE Facilities Coordinator can result in a hold on the student's account, therefore denying access to official transcript and diploma.Graduate students are invited to participate in ECE student professional organizations and projects. Grad students often provide leadership for these efforts.The Virginia Tech Graduate School maintains an up-to-date resource for information regarding grad student life, including housing, international student information, Blacksburg activities, insurance, and student services.

All rights reserved.The department in the College of Engineering has had a milestone year with new and innovative research in budding areas such as quantum engineering, artificial intelligence, and semiconductor technologies — all while boasting first-class faculty and students.26 Jan 2023Virginia Tech’s Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) has generated an electrifying climb all the way to the No. 4 spot in U.S. News & World Report’s rankings for best global universities for electrical and electronic engineering in the United States. The announcement coincides with ECE’s No. 50 ranking in U.S. News & World Report’s global electrical and computer engineering rankings, which featured institutions from 95 countries around the world. This latest top-five ranking focuses on electrical engineering programs in the United States specifically and puts Virginia Tech just behind Princeton, Georgia Tech, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Tied at No. 4 with the University of California, Berkeley, Virginia Tech has established itself as a heavy hitter in electrical engineering research and innovation. 
The Best Global Universities subject rankings are newer U.S. News rankings that prioritize measurable outcomes. Powered by Clarivate, they consider the number of highly cited papers, international collaborations, books, publications, and conferences as well as a candidate’s global and regional research reputation.
Luke Lester, Roanoke Electric Steel Professor and head of the department, noted the significance of the latest ranking as well as the program’s forward momentum.
“With the rise of objective rankings and our department’s passion for outstanding scholarship, we are now seeing the impact of our exceptional research efforts over the last decade,” said Lester. “This important recognition is not just because we have grown to be one of the largest departments in the country, but also because we have many acknowledged experts in our respective fields, including power electronics, power systems, cybersecurity, wireless communications and networks, and software systems."The department’s research expenditures account for more than 10 percent of the university’s $600 million total, with projects covering both ever-evolving fundamentals and cutting-edge concepts. Industry partnerships and government collaborations also have opened up new opportunities for project-based learning at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.Some of the most exciting and recent success for ECE has been the focus on the semiconductor chip-scale integration major for undergraduate students. Paired with cutting-edge research from several faculty members, the department is doing its part to ensure that students are ready to enter the workforce and move the needle on semiconductor development in the commonwealth and beyond.Beyond work stemming from the CHIPS Act are the university’s strategically focused Research Frontiers, which have helped drive the department’s acceleration. In partnership with industry, government, and foundations, these focus areas “address emerging challenges and opportunities that seek to improve the human condition and create a better world for all,” according to Virginia Tech’s Office of Research and Innovation. ECE has faculty and students contributing to innovative advancements in all four of the frontiers: Quantum, Artificial Intelligence, Health, and Security. 
Perhaps one of the most talked-about up-and-coming research areas is quantum engineering. The discipline made a big splash at Virginia Tech this year with the launch of quantum centers on both the Blacksburg and Arlington campuses. Executive leadership includes Lester and J. Byron Maupin Professor of Engineering Wayne Scales. Several more ECE faculty members serve as area experts, mentors to students, and research leads in both locations.
In artificial intelligence, wireless communications, and power electronics and power systems, ECE has some of the most highly cited and well-known researchers making waves in key areas such as 5G and NextG wireless communications, communication networks and smart grids, computer architecture, virtual reality, and more.
Meanwhile, on the Health Frontier, Associate Professor Xiaoting Jia is developing devices to help tackle diseases of the brain and Professor Masoud Agah has prototyped a skin sensor that will be used to detect diseases.
 Virginia Tech’s National Security Institute has a large focus on cybersecurity, and ECE’s Alan Michaels directs the Spectrum Dominance Division. Michaels was recognized as a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors in 2022, an achievement held by only four others at the university – one of them being President Tim Sands.The accolades for the department’s faculty don’t stop with Michaels. Some other top awards earned in the last year include:Recent graduates from the department have also taken notice of the latest ranking. Junbo Zhao earned his Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 2018 and has since become an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Connecticut. Zhao was recently awarded the IEEE Power and Energy Society Young Engineer Award and attributes much of his success to Virginia Tech’s program.
“I heard the exciting news of the ranking on LinkedIn and thought the recognition was a true testament to just how excellent VT ECE is,” said Zhao. “I am so proud to be a Hokie and a member of the ECE family. My education has motivated and prepared me to achieve excellence in the areas of research, education, and service I am doing every day.”With several industry partnerships, government support, and high-caliber faculty and students, Virginia Tech’s electrical and computer engineering department isn’t planning on stopping the momentum anytime soon.
"This accolade is just the beginning of many big things for ECE,” said Lester. “With the collaborations of our faculty, staff and students, the sky’s the limit. I’m especially looking forward to seeing how our presence at the VT Innovation Campus and the addition of use-inspired research to our portfolio will further elevate our reputation. Our ability to attract and inspire top-tier talent from the U.S. and around the world is what is going to allow us to continue to climb even higher up the rankings.”

Link to iframe content: https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/3GWZx4Ub19LrNAmf4dXBjE?utm_source=generatorA simple definition of the metaverse is an attempt to create a digital, virtual replication of reality. Digital twins are virtual replications of systems, such as factories, products, or people. One of the most practical applications for digital twins currently is helping limit real-world risk by providing a virtual space to test potential advances in technology.Artificial intelligence (AI) requires the use of data centers, which use a large amount of electricity to operate and generally do not use renewable energy sources. This results in a large and growing amount of carbon emissions. The metaverse: Where reality and virtual reality collideEnvironmental impact of AI and its sustainability6G vision: The future of wireless communications can be seen through your phone’s camera lens"Curious Conversations" is a series of free-flowing conversations with Virginia Tech researchers that take place at the intersection of world-class research and everyday life.

All rights reserved.18 Sep 2023Blast off into space and explore the solar system through a unique virtual experience that sends users into orbit. With support of a National Science Foundation grant, a team of developers in the Applied Research in Immersive Experiences and Simulations (ARIES) program in University Libraries is using virtual reality to develop an interactive universe. In this experience, users become virtual astronauts and move through space to visit all of the celestial bodies in our solar system. 
“The purpose of this program is to create a virtual reality experience for young learners to engage with STEM content that is inclusive and comfortable in a way that allows for socially constructed learning,” said Todd Ogle,  executive director of ARIES.Instead of using virtual reality headsets, this experience utilizes handheld tablets that serve as windows into the virtual space. “When you’re wearing virtual reality goggles, you can’t engage directly with anyone else in the space with you. You can’t see them. You can’t talk directly to them in an easy or natural way. We wanted learners to be able to use normal social interaction as part of the learning experience,” Ogle said. The virtual environment consists of a 30-by-30-foot space with four devices that track the location and orientation of tablet computers used by the students. Within this virtual environment, young learners can explore the solar system in pairs or solo,  interacting with the content, the teacher, and one another while doing so.The program’s developers created an immersive experience that accurately represents how the solar system functions. This means myth-busting some popular misconceptions.“There are a lot of ideas that students have such as how big all of the planets are and how close they are to each other as well as how the moon phases truly work,” said Matthew Gallagher, computer engineering major and immersive developer on the project. Users are virtually placed in the true-to-size solar system. When accurately presented, planets are impossible to see. The sun, which only takes up two pixels on the screen, is the only object visible to the human eye. To make sense of the black void, the developers placed arrows to point to where planets would be in their orbits.After the actual scale is established, the celestial bodies are enlarged to a size more supportive of active learning. Users are then placed into different scenes, such as the phases of the moon or the mechanism behind the ocean tides, finally having an opportunity to build their own planet. “The kids love the planet-builder feature. They get to pick different attributes like whether it’s a rocky planet or a gas giant, orbit velocity, and where it is placed in our solar system,” said computer science major and immersive developer Clara McDaniel. The creation of the virtual solar system requires collaborative efforts across Virginia Tech and beyond:Working in collaboration with the principal investigators and under the supervision of Sarah Tucker, program coordinator for ARIES, a team of students from disciplines across the university developed the program, incorporating physics, instructional systems design, and art along the way:The virtual solar system is still in its developmental stages, but it is slated to be completed in the fall of 2024. Once finished, it will reside in the Science Museum of Western Virginia as an interactive exhibit.

All rights reserved.13 Sep 2023The Virginia Tech Innovation Campus will open to students in Alexandria in approximately one year. Hundreds of graduate students will start classes at the 11-story, 300,000-square-foot Academic Building One in fall 2024. With the countdown on, construction crews continue to make major progress toward this goal.“We’re starting to see Academic Building One take shape in the façade, giving us an idea of what it’s really going to be," said Summer Cleary, senior project manager at the Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. and Hokie alumna, who oversees the Innovation Campus site. "The building’s structure is what excites me most. It’s so complex and one-of-a-kind in its geometry.”The external glass façade has been installed up to the eighth floor on the building’s western side facing Potomac Avenue. These glass panels, called unitized curtainwall, highlight the building’s unique gem shape. Included in this curtainwall are the terra-cotta structures, called fins, that separate each window pane and give the building its golden sheen.These features are more than decorative. Their placement on the exterior will block some of the direct sunlight into the building and help reduce the energy needed to cool the building.“I cannot express enough thanks to everyone who has contributed to this important project,” said Lance Collins, vice president and executive director of the Innovation Campus. “From the planning by a huge, dedicated group at Virginia Tech to the wonderful design by SmithGroup to the nearly two years of work by Whiting-Turner, we are lucky to have such an outstanding team behind this project. We are all excited to welcome the first students through the doors of the Innovation Campus in fall 2024.”With approximately one year to go, not all progress is visible from the outside. Interior walls are framed in on most levels with a significant portion of drywall hung. Crews have placed much of the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing infrastructure in the walls and ceilings.Preparation is also underway for ceiling installation on the second and third floors.A major milestone in the works is activation of permanent electrical service that will enable interior conditioning and therefore installation of interior finishes.The first step – or rough grading – phase of the site work has begun. The result will be a plaza, green space, and surface parking.  Virginia Tech’s 3.5-acre campus is three blocks from the new Potomac Yard-VT Metro station, connecting Virginia Tech students, faculty, and staff to the center of Northern Virginia’s growing technology corridor. The design of Academic Building One focuses on principles of sustainability, health and wellness, green and social spaces, accessibility, connectivity, flexibility, and integrated technology.Ultimately, the Innovation Campus will include two additional campus buildings, measuring about 150,000 square feet each. See more renderings and a virtual tour on our campus and construction page.In preparation for the 2024 opening, the Innovation Campus has been building up its Master of Engineering program focused on computer science and computer engineering for the past four years. There were more than 250 Innovation Campus master’s students in the region in the spring 2023 semester, and the number is expected to increase this fall.At full build, the Innovation Campus will enroll approximately 750 master’s and 200 doctoral students and graduate 550 master’s and 50 doctoral candidates annually.
