
Virginia Tech (VT), formally the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI),[9] is a public land-grant research university with its main campus in Blacksburg, Virginia. It also has educational facilities in six regions statewide, a research center in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and a study-abroad site in Riva San Vitale, Switzerland. Through its Corps of Cadets ROTC program, Virginia Tech is a senior military college.[10]
Virginia Tech offers 280 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to its 37,000 students; as of 2016, it was the state's second-largest public university by enrollment.[11] It is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".[12]
The university's athletic teams are known as the Virginia Tech Hokies and compete in Division I of the NCAA as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. VT alumni include 2 Rhodes Scholars, 4 Marshall Scholars, 38 Goldwater Scholars, and 131 Fulbright Scholars.[a][14][15][16] Among its alumni are 8 Medal of Honor recipients, 97 flag officers, governors of two U.S. states, 2 astronauts, and a billionaire.[17][18] Three Nobel laureates and one MacArthur Fellow have received a degree or served as faculty members at the university. As of 2015, VT had more than 240,000 living alumni worldwide.[19]
In 1872, with federal funds provided by the Morrill Act of 1862, the Reconstruction-era Virginia General Assembly purchased the facilities of Preston and Olin Institute, a small Methodist school for boys in Southwest Virginia's rural Montgomery County. That same year, 250 acres (100 ha) of the adjoining Solitude Farm including the house and several farm buildings on the estate were acquired for $21,250 from Robert Taylor Preston, a son of Governor of Virginia, James Patton Preston.[20][21] The commonwealth incorporated a new institution on the site, a state-supported land-grant military institute named Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College.[22]
Virginia Tech's first student, Addison "Add" Caldwell registered on October 1, 1872, after hiking over 25 miles from his home in Craig County, Virginia. A statue, located in the Upper Quad of campus commemorates Add's journey to enroll.[23] First-year cadets and their training cadre re-enact Addison Caldwell's journey every year in the Caldwell March. They complete the first half of the 26-mile march in the fall and the second half in the spring.[24]
The first five presidents of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College served in the Confederate States Army or the Confederate government during the Civil War as did many of its early professors including the first Commandant, James H. Lane, a VMI graduate and former Confederate General who taught civil engineering and commerce at the college and is the namesake of Lane Hall, one of the oldest buildings on campus, built in 1888.[25] Its third president, Thomas Nelson Conrad, was a notorious Confederate spy who ran a covert intelligence gathering operation from a home in the heart of Washington, D.C.. Its sixth president, Paul Brandon Barringer, was a son of Confederate General Rufus Barringer and a nephew of Confederate Generals Stonewall Jackson and Daniel Harvey Hill.
In a nod to this southern heritage the Confederate Battle Flag was traditionally waved by cheerleaders at Virginia Tech football games and the Highty-Tighties played Dixie as a fight song when the Hokies scored a touchdown. A large Confederate flag also hung inside Cassell Coliseum where Virginia Tech basketball games are played.[26] Since 1963, "Skipper", a replica of a Civil War cannon has been fired at football games by members of the Corps of Cadets when the team scores.[27] The Confederate Flag was also prominently featured on all Virginia Tech class rings.[28] The display of the Confederate flag at athletic events ended in the late 1960s after Marguerite Harper, a black woman attending Virginia Tech on a Rockefeller Scholarship for culturally disadvantaged students, was elected to the student senate during her sophomore year and made a successful resolution to end the practice. Following the resolution there was a large demonstration in opposition to the removal of the Confederate flag. The campus was covered in Confederate flags and Dixie was blasting from dormitory windows. Harper and her white roommate received hate mail and threatening phone calls, but the resolution stood, and the display of the rebel flag ended in 1969.[29] The Confederate flag on Virginia Tech class rings became optional in 1972 and could be left off of the ring at the student's request.[30] The Confederate flag has since been removed from class ring designs entirely.
Under the leadership of seventh president Joseph Dupuy Eggleston, who held the position from 1913 to 1919, the university established a Reserve Officer Training Corps to support national efforts during World War I. 
In 1917, physics professor Charles E. Vawter, Jr. (son of Charles E. Vawter, who had served on the VPI board of visitors from 1886 to 1900), shot Stockton Heth, Jr., a scion of one of Montgomery County's wealthiest families, in his campus home on faculty row. Heth, who lived at Whitethorne, an antebellum mansion on a 1,500-acre estate near Blacksburg, later died of his wounds. Due to the Heth family's wealth and political connections, Vawter's position as head of the VPI physics department, and the extramarital affair that led to the shooting, the resulting murder trial was one of the most sensational in Virginia history (Vawter was acquitted, and left the school).[31] Eggleston attempted to suppress news of the affair in the media with considerable success, most likely due to world events that stole the headlines in the spring of 1917, rather than his efforts to protect VPI's reputation.
During Thomas Nelson Conrad's tenure as president, the college switched from semesters to the quarter system, which remained in place until the late 1980s. Under the 1891–1907 presidency of John McLaren McBryde, the school organized its academic programs into a traditional four-year college and a graduate department was founded. The evolution of the school's programs led to a name change in 1896 to Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute. The "Agricultural and Mechanical College" portion of the name was popularly omitted almost immediately; in 1944, the name was officially changed to Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI).[32]

VPI admitted its first female students in 1921 as civilian day students; they did not live on campus.  In 1923, VPI changed a policy of compulsory participation in the Corps of Cadets from four years to two years. In 1931, VPI began teaching classes at the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary (now Old Dominion University).[33] This program eventually developed into a two-year engineering program that allowed students to transfer to VPI for their final two years of degree work. The first women's dormitory at VPI, Hillcrest Hall, was built in 1940. In 1943, VPI merged with Radford State Teachers College in nearby Radford, which became VPI's women's division; the merger was dissolved in 1964. Today, Radford University is a co-educational research university that enrolls nearly 10,000 students and offers more than 150 undergraduate and graduate programs.[34]
In 1953 under the leadership of President Walter Stephenson Newman, VPI became the first historically white, four-year public institution among the 11 states in the former Confederacy to admit a black undergraduate. Three more black students were admitted in 1954. At the time Virginia still enforced Jim Crow laws and largely practiced racial segregation in public and private education, churches, neighborhoods, restaurants, and movie theaters and these first black students at VPI were not allowed to live in residence halls or eat in the dining halls on campus. Instead, they boarded with African American families in Blacksburg. In 1958, Charlie L. Yates made history as the first African American to graduate from VPI. Yates earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, with honors, and was hailed as the first African American "to be graduated from any major Southern engineering institute," according to news reports at the time.[35]
VPI President T. Marshall Hahn, whose tenure ran from 1962 to 1974,[36] was responsible for many of the programs and policies that transformed VPI from a small, historically white, predominately male, military institute with a primary focus on undergraduate teaching into a major co-educational research university. The student body that had been approximately 5,682 in 1962 increased by roughly 1,000 students each year, new dormitories and academic buildings were constructed, faculty members were added – in 1966, for instance, more than 100 new professors joined the faculty – and research budgets were increased.[36] During Hahn's tenure, not only did the university graduate its first Rhodes Scholar, W.W. Lewis, Class of 1963,[37] the requirement for male students to participate in the Corps of Cadets for two years was dropped in 1964. Beginning in the fall 1973, women could participate in the Corps, making Virginia Tech among the nation's first senior military colleges to integrate women.[38]
In 1970, the state legislature allowed VPI university status and gave it the present legal name, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. In the early 1990s, university administration authorized the official use of Virginia Tech as equivalent to the full legal name; it has been used as the first-reference name for the school's athletic teams since the 1970s. However, diplomas and transcripts still spell out the formal name. Similarly, the abbreviation "VT" is far more common today than either VPI or VPI&SU.
During the Vietnam War, students on college campuses across the nation protested the draft and U.S. involvement in the conflict. Despite its long history as a military school, Virginia Tech was no exception. Most protests at Virginia Tech were small sit-ins and teach-ins, but In mid-April 1970 a group of anti-war protesters including students and faculty members disrupted a Corps of Cadets drill on campus. The Virginia Tech administration under Dr. Hahn took swift action. The students involved were suspended and the faculty members involved were fired from the university and the administration went to court and obtained an injunction to prevent them from repeating the act. This succeeded in calming tensions on campus, but only for a few weeks.[39]
Tensions on campus reached the boiling point several days following the Kent State Shootings when on May 12, 1970, a large mob including students and a number of non-student anti-war protesters enraged by the Kent State incident and angered by the administration's disciplinary actions in response to a number of recent infractions by protesters including; vandalism of university property, a series of potentially dangerous fires set on campus, breaking and entering into a university building, and a sit-in in Cowgill Hill, seized Williams Hall and barricaded themselves inside.[40] The administration responded quickly calling in law enforcement and early the following morning Virginia State Police forced their way into Williams Hall and began rounding up the protesters. Once inside the building the police discovered bomb making materials and determined that the students had apparently intended to build a firebomb. The first few protesters were dragged out of the building; the rest left peacefully and were arrested and taken to the Montgomery County jail. The students involved in the seizure, were suspended from Virginia Tech and given twenty-four hours to remove their belongings from campus after being released from jail.
Several more anti-war protests occurred at Virginia Tech during the early 1970s, but none turned violent.[39]
The university continued to expand through the last quarter of the 20th century. In 1975 William E. Lavery, who had joined the Virginia Tech faculty in 1966, took over as president when Dr. Hahn left the university to join Georgia-Pacific.[41]
Desperate for additional farmland for the support of teaching, research, and extension programs in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Virginia Tech acquired Kentland Farm on December 31, 1986. Virginia Tech secretly traded about 250 acres of research orchards adjacent to a commercial area that would soon become Christiansburg's main shopping district to a group of developers for the historic but long fallow 1,785-acre Kentland property. The developers on the other end of the swap, one of whom was a former Tech athletics official, quickly sold 40 acres of the former university farmland for $2.7 million. News of the land swap, and especially the fact that it was done behind closed doors, sparked outrage.[42]
Also in 1986, Virginia Tech became embroiled in an athletic scandal sparked by allegations of illegal recruiting, the bitter departure of two athletic directors in less than a year and millions of dollars of debt run up by the university's sports program due to mismanagement of financial resources, million dollar coaching contracts, and lavish expense accounts for athletics officials that led to a rebuke from Governor of Virginia, Gerald Baliles in 1987.  Baliles, the featured speaker at the Virginia Tech's 115th annual commencement exercises, scolded the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors for the scandal and warned other state-supported institutions in Virginia not to put athletics ahead of academics.[43]
Lavery developed a reorganization plan for the troubled Athletic Department, and Frank Beamer was hired to replace Bill Dooley as head football coach, but with negative publicity continuing to swirl within and around the university, he announced his resignation on October 16, 1987, effective December 31, 1987, to prevent polarization of the campus.[44] He was succeeded as president by James Douglas McComas who served until 1994.
Due to the unpopularity of US involvement in the Vietnam War enrollment in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets spiraled downward through the 1970s and 80s. In 1991 through the efforts of Henry Dekker (Class of 1944) The Corps of Cadets Alumni Inc. was created to save the corps, whose numbers had declined to only a few hundred students. In 1992 the alumni organization-initiated Corps Review, a newsletter that was expanded to a magazine in 2004 and targeted corps alumni. In the mid-1990s, the corps alumni organization set a goal of "1000 in 2000" and initiated a major campaign to push the number of cadets to 1,000 by the turn of the century. The goal was not reached, but membership in the corps did increase substantially by the end of the decade.[45]
The early decades of this century have seen expansion across the university's institutions in both physical and population sizes. In 2001, Virginia Tech acquired 326 acres of the Heth Farm adjacent to campus, increasing the College Farm to over 3,000 acres.[46] The Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute was created with a strategic partnership with the Carilion Clinic and the governor of Virginia. These years also brought about the rapid development of the university's professional schools of graduate education and business programs. Virginia Tech brought in over $500 million in research expenditures in 2014.[47]
The establishment of scholarships for cadets and a resurgence of national patriotism after the September 11 attacks helped the corps recruit new cadets, increasing the ranks to 1,127 by 2018—the largest corps the university has seen since the mid-1960s.[45][48] The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is poised to increase enrollment to 1,400 in coming years.[49]
On April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech student Seung-Hui Cho fatally shot 32 faculty members and students and wounded 17 others in two locations on campus before killing himself. The massacre is the deadliest mass shooting on an American college campus, surpassing the University of Texas tower shooting in 1966. Although it was at the time the deadliest mass shooting committed by a lone gunman in U.S. history, it has since been surpassed by two shootings at an Orlando nightclub and an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas.[50][51][52] It is the second-deadliest school massacre in U.S. history, surpassed only by the Bath School bombing in 1927 that killed 44.[53]
The Virginia Tech massacre led to an intense nationwide debate over gun rights, gun safety and efficacy of gun-free zones. It prompted many states to introduce legislation to prohibit public colleges and universities from banning concealed weapons on campus for permit holders. In 2013, at least 19 states introduced legislation to allow concealed carry on campus in some form, and in the 2014 legislative session, at least 14 states introduced similar legislation. In 2016, Tennessee passed a bill permitting faculty members to carry handguns on campus after notifying local law enforcement. In 2015, Texas became the eighth state to allow concealed weapons on college campuses. In December 2016, Governor John Kasich signed a bill into law that lifted Ohio's statewide ban on firearms on college campuses, leaving the decision to the institutions.[54] In 2017, Georgia became the tenth state to prohibit colleges and universities from banning concealed weapons on campus.[55] Virginia law allows individual institutions to make the decision whether to allow concealed weapons on campus, but Virginia Tech continues to ban concealed carry permit holders from carrying guns on campus.[56]
After Amazon unveiled its second headquarters in Crystal City, Virginia, Virginia Tech announced plans to build a $1 billion graduate research center adjacent to the facility. The Virginia Tech Innovation Campus will be housed at a million-square-foot campus in Alexandria. It is expected to educate hundreds of graduate students. The Innovation Campus will focus on computer science and software engineering, with specializations in areas including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and data analytics.[57]
Due to rapid growth of incoming freshmen classes, the university announced in 2019 that it would offer 1,559 incoming, in-state freshmen financial incentives to skip the 2019–20 school year in Blacksburg.[58] Expecting a larger-than-planned class size, the university budgeted $3.3 million for the endeavor. Virginia Tech also waived the requirement that freshmen live on campus for the 2019–20 school year, leased an off-campus Holiday Inn, and converted its on-campus hotel to house students.
Virginia Tech is a public university and one of Virginia's two land-grant institutions. Its academic programs are administered by nine colleges, the Graduate School, and the Honors College.
Virginia Tech offers 116 bachelor's degree programs through its nine undergraduate academic colleges,[60] 160 master's and doctoral degree programs through the Graduate School, and a professional degree from the Virginia–Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. In addition, the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute is a public/private partnership jointly managed by Virginia Tech and the Carilion Clinic founded on January 3, 2007.[61]
Virginia Tech received a record number of nearly 22,500 applications for the fall 2015 freshman class, an increase of 7.6% from the previous year's 20,897 applications for an overall admissions rate of 65.8%. The typical student offered admission had a high-school grade point average of 4.00, with the middle 50 percent ranging from 3.84 and 4.27. The average cumulative SAT score was 1250 (out of 1600), with a middle range ranging from 1160 to 1340. Of the 5,518 students who accepted the offers of admission (for an admissions yield of 38%)[discuss], 18 percent accepted under the Early Decision Plan.[64] The Office of Undergraduate Admissions is located within the Visitor and Undergraduate Admissions Center.[65]
Virginia Tech offers a highly selective Honors College, which provides undergraduate students 11 different ways to earn Honors credits towards one of the five Honors degree options. Once admitted, Honors students are required to maintain a 3.6 GPA in order to remain in the program. Roughly one-fourth of the approximately 1,600 University Honors students live in one of the two University Honors residential halls, the Honors Residential College located in East Ambler-Johnston and the Hillcrest Honors Community.[66]
For the 2013–14 academic year, the Graduate School at Virginia Tech enrolled 6,723 graduate students (4,465 full-time; 2,258 part-time) in its masters and doctoral programs.[67]
The Pamplin College of Business received 381 applications for its incoming Evening MBA program and offered admission to 142. The class's average GMAT was 610, and mean undergraduate GPA was 3.4.[68]
The Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine in Roanoke, Va., received 4,403 applications for its eighth incoming class, the class of 2021, and offered admission to 42. The class's MCAT scores range was 503–520 (median 512, mean 512), and mean undergraduate GPA was 3.57.[69]
In 2023, Virginia Tech became the second public university after the U.S. Supreme Court decided Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, banning affirmative action in college admissions, to end its use of legacy admissions.[70] The university also ended its binding early decision program because it "created unneeded pressure on students [...] particularly those needing financial aid".[70]
In U.S. News & World Report's list of "2023 Best Colleges", Virginia Tech tied for 62nd overall among national universities, tied for 23rd among public ones, tied at 41st for "Most Innovative", ranked 156th in "Best Value Schools", and tied for 291st in "Top Performers on Social Mobility".[81]
The Pamplin College of Business's part-time MBA program was tied for 19th overall by U.S. News & World Report in 2020.[79] The Master of Information Technology program, jointly sponsored by the Pamplin College of Business and the College of Engineering, is ranked No. 4 in U.S. News & World Report's Best Online Graduate Computer Information Technology Programs.[82] This interdisciplinary program is offered entirely online.[82]
Programs in the College of Architecture and Urban Studies (CAUS) include architecture + design, landscape architecture, urban planning, and public administration. In its 2016 "America's Best Architecture & Design Schools" report, DesignIntelligence ranked the undergraduate architecture program 3rd nationally among both public and private universities. The graduate architecture program ranked 9th in the nation.[83] For 2013, DesignIntelligence ranked the university's undergraduate and graduate landscape architecture programs No. 2 in the nation. In addition, DesignIntelligence ranked the university's undergraduate interior design program 6th and undergraduate industrial design program 3rd.[84] The Planetizen 2012 Guide to Graduate Urban Planning Programs ranked Virginia Tech's MURP program as 19th. Virginia Tech's MURP program was also rated among the best programs in Technology, Land Use Planning, Environmental Planning, and Growth Management.[85]
Kiplinger's Personal Finance places Virginia Tech 20th in its 2019 ranking of 174 best value public colleges in the United States.[86] In 2018, CEOWORLD magazine ranked the undergraduate architecture program 3rd nationally.[87] The graduate architecture program ranked 14th.[88]
Virginia Tech received the following rankings from The Princeton Review in its 2017 Best 380 Colleges Rankings:[89]

Virginia Tech's research and development expenditures (R&D) were $542 million in fiscal year 2019, which ranked 48th among education institutions in the nation and 2nd in the state of Virginia according to the National Science Foundation.[90] As a result, Virginia Tech marked its 15th consecutive year of research growth, with the university's research portfolio more than doubling from $192.7 million in fiscal year 2000. The only Virginia institution in the top 50 of the NSF's rankings for research expenditures, Virginia Tech is No. 23 among public universities. The university's research expenditures rank it in the top 5 percent of more than 900 research universities and colleges. Each year, the university receives thousands of awards to conduct research from an ever-expanding base of sponsors. Researchers pursue new discoveries in agriculture, biotechnology, information and communication technology, human health, transportation, energy management (including leadership in fuel-cell technology and power electronics), security, sustainability, and a wide range of other engineering, scientific, social science, and creative fields. This research led to 36 patents and 17 license and option agreements in fiscal year 2013.[91]: 5 
The Fralin Life Science Institute is an expansion of the Fralin Biotechnology Center, which was established in 1991.[92] Research at the institute is focused on the areas of vector-borne disease; infectious disease and microbial sciences; plant sciences; obesity; cancer biology; and ecology and organismal biology.[93]
The Biocomplexity Institute of Virginia Tech, formerly known as the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, is a bioinformatics, computational biology, and systems biology research facility that opened in 2000 on Virginia Tech's main campus in Blacksburg, Virginia. The institute houses more than 200 employees and multiple supercomputing clusters, and it has more than $109 million in active research awards.
The Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) was founded as the Center for Transportation Research in 1988 and employs more than 350 personnel. VTTI has more than $125 million in active research awards, and has a mission to save lives, save time, save money, and protect the environment. It is the second largest university-level transportation institute in the United States, and the largest group of driving safety researchers in the world. Facilities include the 2.2-mile (3.5 km), two-lane, fully instrumented Virginia Smart Road; connected-vehicle test beds in Southwest and Northern Virginia; more than 83,000 square feet of office and laboratory space; the VTTI/Center for Injury Biomechanics Crash Sled Lab; and the National Tire Research Center in Southern Virginia.[94] These laboratories include an asphalt lab, fully equipped garages, instrumentation bays, and a machine shop for working on VTTI's vehicle fleet.[95]
VTTI develops and tests advanced transportation safety devices, techniques, and innovative applications. VTTI's research impacts public policy in transportation, notably through research into distracted driving[96] and commercial hour-of-service.[97]
VTTI conducts applied research to address transportation challenges from various perspectives: vehicle, driver, infrastructure, materials, and environment.[47] Most notable among VTTI endeavors are its naturalistic driving studies. These studies particularly utilize VTTI's data acquisition systems, which gather continuous video and driving performance data in real-world driving conditions. These systems have been installed in nearly 4,000 passenger vehicles, commercial trucks and motor coaches, and motorcycles.[98]
Since 2005, the Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science (ICTAS) has made efforts to build capacity at the intersection of engineering, science, biology, and the humanities. Thrust areas include nuclear engineering, nanoscale science and engineering, nano-bio interface, sustainable energy, safe and sustainable water, national security, cognition and communication systems, renewable materials, and emerging technologies. The first director was Roop L. Mahajan (2005–2016) and the current director is Dr. Stefan Duma (2016–present).[47]
Other research conducted throughout the university's colleges and interdisciplinary groups includes high-performance computing; advanced materials; wireless telecommunication; housing; human and animal health; cognition, development, and behavior; the environment; and energy, including power electronics, biofuels, fuel cells, and solar-powered building structures.[99]
The Virginia Tech campus is in Blacksburg, Virginia. Most buildings are built of limestone in a neo-Gothic style. Notable green spaces include the Hahn Horticulture Garden, Virginia Tech Duck Pond, and the old-growth forest, Stadium Woods.
The central campus is roughly bordered by Prices Fork Road to the northwest, Plantation Drive to the west, Main Street to the east, and US 460 Bypass to the south, though it has several thousand acres beyond the central campus.
In the center of the Blacksburg campus lies the Drillfield, a large oval field running northeast to southwest, encircled by a one-way street that is known as Drillfield Drive. The Drillfield's name, coined in 1926 after the completion of Virginia Tech's first real stadium, Miles Stadium, stems from its use by the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets to conduct military drills. A waterway, Stroubles Creek, runs beneath the Drillfield on the south side. A three-sided conduit for the creek that retains the natural bed of the creek was installed in 1934, and, in 1971, the first two asphalt walks were added. [104]
On the northwestern side of the Drillfield stand most of the university's academic and administrative buildings, including Burruss and McBryde Halls. On the southeastern side of the Drillfield stand most of the residential buildings, including students' residence halls, dining halls, and War Memorial Gym. Newman Library is on the eastern side of campus and connects to Torgersen Bridge, which spans the main road into campus, Alumni Mall. North of the Drillfield and northwest of Alumni Mall lies the Upper Quad, known to many students as military campus. The Upper Quad is home to the Corps of Cadets' barracks.
On the main campus in Blacksburg, most of the buildings incorporate Hokie Stone as a building material. In 2010, the board of visitors passed a resolution about using the gray stone, shaded by hues of brown and pink, in all building projects.[105]
The university has established five branch campuses:[106]
Virginia Tech's presence in the Washington Metropolitan Area links regional graduate education and outreach programs that are consistent with the university's strategic research areas of excellence: energy materials and environment, social and individual transformation, health, food, and nutrition, and innovative technologies and complex systems.[112]
Supporting the university's missions is the Virginia Tech National Capital Region. The university has established collaborations and partnerships with local and federal agencies, nonprofit research organizations, businesses, and other institutions of higher education. Current locations include Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Falls Church, Leesburg, Manassas, and Middleburg.
Biomedical Technology Development and Management is an executive program in the National Capital Region. The Master of Science in Biomedical Technology Development and Management (BTDM) is a graduate level degree created by Virginia Tech in response to future directions in medical product discovery and development and the emerging needs of industry and regulatory agencies. Curriculum for the degree program integrates science with technology, management, ethics, and public policy, and draws on the strengths of Virginia Tech in science, industrial and systems engineering, business and management, and medical research programs.[113]
In 2014, the university opened a Language and Culture Institute location in Fairfax.[114] The institute offers intensive English language programs for college-age students, professionals, and diplomats.[115]
Located on the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic, the Caribbean Center for Education and Research (CCER) in Punta Cana provides a base for Virginia Tech faculty to conduct research as well as instruct students on biodiversity, environmental and social sustainability, global issues in natural resources, and hotel and tourism management. The center is the product of a partnership between Virginia Tech and the PUNTACANA Ecological Foundation (PCEF) and the PUNTACANA Resort and Club. PCEF maintains a 2,000-acre (810 ha) natural forest reserve, 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) of protected coral reef, freshwater lagoons and coastal mangroves.[116]
Renamed the Steger Center for International Scholarship in 2014,[117] the Center for European Studies and Architecture (CESA) is the university's European campus center and base for operations and support of its programs in the region. The center's location in Riva San Vitale, Ticino, the Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland, is also close to major northern Italian cities such as Milan.[116]
Virginia Tech has several agricultural research and extension centers located throughout the Commonwealth dedicated to improving agricultural practices and the quality of life of Virginia citizens. The Virginia Tech Agricultural Research and Extension Centers are: Alson H. Smith, Jr., Eastern Shore, Eastern Virginia, Hampton Roads, Middleburg, Reynolds Homestead, Shenandoah Valley, Southern Piedmont, Southwest Virginia, Tidewater, and Virginia Seafood.
Distinguished by a towering 180-foot-high radial brick smokestack, the university's coal fired Central Steam Power Plant generates an annual steam output greater than 943 billion BTUs and provides campus buildings with a portion of their heat, hot water, and electricity needs. Nearly 90 percent of campus buildings are connected to the plant through an extensive network of tunnels—the main access point is on the Drillfield—and more than six miles (9.7 km) of steam lines and piping provide heat to more than 6.8 million square feet of campus buildings. Only personnel with confined-space training are permitted to enter the tunnel system, comprising 2.76 miles (4.44 km) of inaccessible tunnel and 11.07 miles (17.82 km) of piping; 3.78 miles (6.08 km) of direct-bury piping in the ground; and 2.2 miles (3.5 km) of accessible tunnel and 12.27 miles (19.75 km) of piping.[118]
There are more than 700 student organizations on campus. Some of these organizations include Bolt at Virginia Tech which builds electric racing motorcycles; PRISM a student-run ad agency; BASIS at Virginia Tech the largest student-run fixed income portfolio group in the nation managing $5 million; the Chocolate Milk Club; and a Young Life Chapter. Over 9,300 Virginia Tech students reside on campus.[120]
Until 1923, every able-bodied male was required to participate for four years in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets. The requirement was changed to two years until 1964, when participation became voluntary. Members of the ROTC program are required to participate in the Corps of Cadets. Virginia Tech remains one of three public universities in the United States with both an active corps of cadets and regular civilian students on its campus (Texas A&M University and the University of North Georgia are the other two).
More than 1,000 cadets reside on the campus of Virginia Tech. The Corps of Cadets Community is located in the Upper Quad, which features some of the oldest buildings on campus. Cadet dorms are also known as "cadet barracks". Two new dormitories were constructed on the Upper Quad to house all of the cadets. Pearson Hall replaced Rasche Hall in November 2015, and in August 2017, Brodie Hall was replaced by the New Cadet Dorm (a.k.a. "New Brodie").[121] Former cadet dorms, Thomas Hall and Monteith Hall were demolished in 2017. Their sites are planned to be used as green space for the foreseeable future.
Virginia Tech hosts a number of fraternities and sororities across four governing councils. There are 23 IFC fraternities and 13 National Panhellenic Conference sororities recognized at Virginia Tech. The fraternity and sorority community currently encompasses more than 5,500 students which represents just about 20 percent of the undergraduate population.[122] The Oak Lane Community[123] houses those sororities and fraternities which have houses chartered on campus. A number of fraternities have chartered off-campus housing. There are also numerous other academic and service-related sororities and fraternities at the school, as well as various historically Black and cultural interest organizations.[122]
There are also a number of fraternities at Virginia Tech that are not officially recognized by the university. 
Virginia Tech teams are known as the Hokies. The HokieBird is a turkey-like creature whose form has evolved from the original school mascot of the Fighting Gobbler. While the modern HokieBird still resembles a Fighting Gobbler, the word "Hokie" has all but replaced Fighting Gobbler in terms of colloquial use. The term originated from the Old Hokie yell. 
They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports since the 2004–05 season. The Hokies previously competed in the Big East Conference from 2000–01 to 2003–04 (football program from 1991–92 to 1999–2000); the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) from 1995–96 to 1999–2000; and the Metro Conference from 1978–79 to 1994–95.
Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and wrestling. Women's sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and volleyball.
Virginia Tech's fight song, "Tech Triumph", was written in 1919 and remains in use today. The song is played at sporting events by both the Virginia Tech student band, The Marching Virginians, and the regimental Corps of Cadets' band, the Highty Tighties.
The most prominent athletic facilities are Lane Stadium, Cassell Coliseum, English Field, Thompson Field, Tech Softball Park, Rector Field House, the Beamer-Lawson Indoor Practice Facility, and the Christiansburg Aquatic Center.

Blacksburg is an incorporated town in Montgomery County, Virginia, United States, with a population of 44,826 at the 2020 census. Blacksburg, and the surrounding county is dominated economically and demographically by the presence of Virginia Tech.[5]
Blacksburg, Christiansburg, and the city of Radford are the three principal jurisdictions of the Blacksburg-Christiansburg Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses those jurisdictions and all of Montgomery, Pulaski, and Giles counties for statistical purposes. The MSA has an estimated population of 181,863[6] and is currently one of the faster-growing MSAs in Virginia.
Blacksburg High School, which in 2013 opened a new building,[7] is often ranked among the top schools of the nation for its academics. Its soccer, track, and cross-country teams are also among the top in the state .[citation needed]
In the mid-1600s, English colonists were still uncertain of what lay beyond the Allegheny Mountains, whose topography and possession by native inhabitants, Tutelo-speaking tribes, were a barrier to expanded settlement by the Colony of Virginia. Abraham Wood, who commanded Fort Henry on the frontier (now the site of Petersburg, Virginia), and operated an Indian trading post nearby, organized several expeditions to explore farther west. A passage over the ridge was finally found in 1671 when explorers Batts and Fallam, sent by Wood, reached the present-day location of Blacksburg, Virginia. Their expedition followed Stroubles Creek, through the current locations of the town and campus of Virginia Tech, to what they named Wood's River.
They reported the area as inhabited by the Monacan and Moneton, Siouan-speaking groups, but the Virginian colonial legislature had authorized Wood to claim it. Accordingly, on September 17, 1671, the Batts and Fallam party claimed all of the lands comprising the river's drainage basin for King Charles II. However, the region was not yet open to English patent. In 1700, Seneca warriors of the Iroquois Confederacy based in New York and Pennsylvania, overran the entire area, driving out the other bands. As early as 1718, the Seneca had agreed to sell the parts they had conquered east of the Blue Ridge to the Colony of Virginia. Following another cession at the 1744 Treaty of Lancaster, however, there was a dispute between the tribe and colonists over whether the new boundary was the Alleghenies or the Ohio River. The site of Blacksburg lay just within this disputed zone.
By the 1740s, the Wood's River Land Company, represented by Colonel James Patton, gained a large tract of land within present-day southwest Virginia. Part of the tract became Montgomery County and Pulaski County and was sold to Virginian, Irish, Scots-Irish, and English settlers as a reward for their services during the American Indian Wars and other wars. The Draper and Ingles families were among those who built their homes at Draper's Meadow by 1748; this area was between the present location of the campus and the subdivision of Hethwood.
Because of its strategic location between powerful Indian nations, who alternately allied with the French or British as it suited them, plus its location through gaps into the Alleghenies further west, the area's development was viewed with increasing apprehension by the French and their Indian allies. In July 1755, during the French and Indian War, hostile Shawnee Indians equipped and armed by France attacked the frontier outpost at Draper's Meadow, which then had around twenty pioneer settlers. About four settlers were killed in the attacks, and five were taken captive to Kentucky by the Shawnee, among them Mary Draper Ingles, who later escaped. The memorial to Draper's Meadow massacre was dedicated on a bridge located near Duck Pond. By the end of the war, Draper's Meadow was deserted.[8][9]
By the Treaty of Easton (1758), and again by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the British Crown made the Allegheny ridge separating the Mississippi and Chesapeake watersheds the official boundary between their Virginia colony and native peoples. It remained so until 1768, when native claims to the land including Blacksburg were cleared by the Treaty of Hard Labour with the Cherokee, and the Treaty of Fort Stanwix with the Six Nations (Iroquois Confederacy). The Shawnee finally abandoned their claim to this territory in 1774 following Dunmore's War.
Samuel Black, whose family settled in Staunton, Virginia, bought 600 acres (2.4 km2) of land in the Draper's Meadow area for his sons John and William in 1772. Smithfield Plantation, built in approximately 1774 by Colonel William Preston,[9] was developed on the original Draper's Meadow site, near the current location of the Duck Pond on the Virginia Tech campus.
When Samuel Black died in 1792, the land was evenly divided into two sections by his sons. The road now known as Draper Road is the dividing line between the sections. John Black's property was later developed as the majority of the central campus of Virginia Tech.
In 1797, William Black laid out a small grid of streets and lots comprising 16 blocks on a portion of his land. The original town was limited to the area bounded by present-day Draper Road, Jackson Street, Wharton Street, and Clay Street.[8] The town logo contains 16 small squares that create a larger square, representing the original 16 square blocks that were a part of Black's design.
After Black petitioned the state legislature to establish a town at the site, the official establishment and founding of Blacksburg was January 13, 1798, on the 38.75-acre (15.68 ha) tract that he laid out.[10] The following August 4, he signed over the deed to the town trustees.[8] The town was named after him in his honor.
In 1808, a log cabin was built just east of Smithfield Plantation. Robert Preston, a future colonel of the 28th Virginia Infantry,[11] lived here, as did two Virginia governors. The cabin was later added to in the mid 19th century to create a Greek Revival farmhouse now known as Solitude, which is the oldest building on the Virginia Tech campus. In 1872, the 250 acre Solitude farm became the central campus of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, and the house, after the death of its owner in the following decade, served as a college infirmary from 1882 to 1886. It was later used for faculty housing.[12]
According to records of the Post Office Department of the National Archives and Records Administration, the post office was established as "BLACKSBURGH" on April 8, 1827. The name was changed to the current spelling (without the "h") in 1893.[13]
The Methodists had built two cabins to worship in since the town's founding, but they did not build a more permanent structure until 1830, when they constructed a brick church.[14] The Presbyterians were the next Christian denomination to build a church within Blacksburg's limits. In 1848 they built their first brick building[15] at 117 South Main Street. Though still standing, this building has not been used as a church for many years.[14] It was once South Main Café,[16] but is currently used as a restaurant called Cabo Fish Taco.[17] It is also the oldest building on Main Street.[15] The Baptists founded the third oldest church in the town in 1852.[14]
In 1832, Westview Cemetery was established from a few acres of land that were deeded to trustees.[14]
One of the first educational establishments started here was the Blacksburg Female Academy in 1840.[16] The Olin and Preston Institute (re-charted as Preston and Olin Institute in 1869) was a Methodist-sponsored academy established in 1851.[18]
The first bank in Montgomery County, Blacksburg Savings Institution, was established in 1849.[16] The first newspaper published in Blacksburg was the Montgomery Messenger. Its first issue was printed in 1869.[18]
In 1871, the village that became known as Blacksburg was incorporated[13] and Thomas W. Jones became the first mayor.[19]
One year later, the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College opened on October 2, 1872, with a faculty of three members.[13] The college grew and became known as Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, which shortly afterward became informally referred to as Virginia Tech. It is a Virginia land-grant university.
A fire-fighting unit was organized within the university in 1899.[14] The town bought its first fire truck 43 years later.[16] The Blacksburg First Aid and Life Saving Crew was founded in 1951 and renamed Blacksburg Volunteer Rescue Squad in another addition to the growing amount of emergency services.[16]
The first automobile came through the town in 1901. Three years later the train entered Blacksburg from Christiansburg using the Virginia Anthracite & Coal Railroad, which later became known as the "Huckleberry."[20] Traffic in Blacksburg increased sufficiently enough that by January 1913 the town voted against allowing cows to continue to roam in town. The first filling station was opened in 1919 and at the time was the only one between Roanoke, Virginia, and Bluefield, West Virginia.[20] The town's first landing strip was built in 1929 and was 1,800 feet (548.64 m) in length. The grass landing strip was given airport status in 1931 and later became Virginia Tech Airport. Local buses began to make their rounds for the first time in 1947.[16]
The town's first theater was built in 1909. It was a precursor to the Lyric Theatre on College Avenue.[21]
In the spring of 1935, Main Street was strung with ten street lights from Roanoke Street northward to the top of the hill, where it now intersects the Alumni Mall. By October the town's second stoplight was installed on Main Street at Roanoke Street and was synchronized with the original one at Main and College.[20] The establishment of official law enforcement began in 1937 when Officer Dave "Highpockets" Sumner became the first Blacksburg police officer. The first police car was purchased nine years later.[16]
Blacksburg experienced a boost of compulsory education during the second half of the 20th century. Even though there had been a place for secondary education somewhere in town since 1906, it was not until 1952 when the first facility for Blacksburg High School was built on South Main and Eheart Streets. Later it moved to new quarters and was adapted as Blacksburg Middle School. That same year, all high schools in Montgomery County began operating on a twelve-grade basis which is still county policy to this day.[22]
The Margaret J. Beeks Elementary School and the Gilbert F. Linkous Elementary School were both completed in 1963 and Harding Avenue Elementary School was built in 1972.[16] Two years later, in 1974, Blacksburg High School moved its location to Patrick Henry Drive after 20 years of issues with overcrowding in its previous location.[22]
Jack Goodwin was appointed the first chief of police by the Blacksburg Town Council in 1954. Jan Olinger was made the first female police officer in 1976.[16]
1958 marked the beginning of the end for the railroad that came to be known as the "Huckleberry." In the 1960s, however, railroads underwent restructuring. Passenger service came to an end on July 25. On June 30, 1966, the last freight train arrived at the Blacksburg depot. Within 24 hours, the depot was closed, the empty cars were picked up, and the tracks were immediately removed.[20] After years of effort by the citizens of the town a trail was constructed on the former railroad right-of-way and, after years of construction, funding and planning issues the Huckleberry Trail was opened to the public on December 1, 1998. 190 years after its original construction, the newly renovated Smithfield Plantation house was re-opened in 1964.[16]
The amount of commercialization in the area began to increase in the mid-1960s. The Corning Glass Works (now called Corning Incorporated), based in upper New York State, opened a manufacturing facility in 1964 that is located south of Blacksburg. The Blacksburg Municipal Building on South Main Street was constructed in 1969.[16] Terrace View apartments, the first large student complex, was built in 1970. The Blacksburg Branch of the Montgomery County Library was opened the same year. Ten years later, it was moved into the facility that used to house the Blacksburg Lumber Company on Draper Road. In 1971, Blacksburg ratified a new charter and LewisGale Hospital Montgomery was built. The University Mall shopping center opened that year as well. In the mid 1970s the Foxridge apartments, an even larger student apartment complex, was built as part of the Hethwood development. During 1981, the Blacksburg Community Center opened. It cost the town $1.2 million to build.[16] By 1988, the New River Valley Mall, located in the neighboring town of Christiansburg, was opened[20] and the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center had its first ground-breaking ceremony.[18]
After construction of Virginia's portion of Interstate 81 began in 1957, nine years passed before the Christiansburg-area segment was opened.[23] About half that amount of time passed before the U.S. Route 460 bypass opened in 1969.[16]
In the 1970s, Virginia Tech was annexed into the town and the town acquired other land. Together with the effect of the annexations, the population grew from 9,000 people to 30,000 during this decade. Replacing the old public bus system, Blacksburg Transit began running in 1983.[24]
Blacksburg is the site of the Blacksburg Electronic Village or BEV, conceived as a computer networking project of Virginia Tech in 1991 and officially born in 1993 as a way to link the town together using the Internet. This project quickly ushered the town into what is being called the Information Age.
In 1994, Montgomery County Public Schools completed construction of Kipps Elementary School at 2801 Prices Fork Road.[16] By this time, Blacksburg had five elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school.[22] A newly renovated Blacksburg branch library was opened in 1996.[16]
In the aftermath of railroad restructuring, many rail lines were abandoned. After 24 years of abandonment and six years of planning and construction, the first phase of the Huckleberry Trail built on the old Huckleberry railbed opened in 1996. The second phase of construction was completed in 1998.[16] In 2019, the Blacksburg Rotary Mountain Bike Skills Park opened with funding from Blacksburg Parks and Recreation and donations.
On July 8, 1997, ground was broken for the experimental "Smart Road" project. The second phase of construction was completed in 2002.[25] The road is currently closed to the public and used as a research test bed for the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. A National Weather Service office is located in Blacksburg and serves most of southwestern Virginia, southeast West Virginia, and northwest North Carolina.
In 2003, the new building for Blacksburg Middle School students opened on Prices Fork Road adjacent to the property housing Kipps Elementary School.
On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho shot 32 people dead and injured an additional 17 in the Virginia Tech shooting before committing suicide. The massacre is the deadliest mass shooting on a college campus since the University of Texas tower shooting in 1966.
On January 21, 2009, Zhu Haiyang decapitated Yang Xin at Virginia Tech in the first campus murder since the Virginia Tech shooting.[26]
On February 13, 2010, following a snowstorm that dropped two feet of snow on the area, the gymnasium roof on the previously occupied Blacksburg High School suffered a catastrophic structural failure and collapsed, causing structural damage to other areas of the school. The school building was condemned and students attended night school on a split schedule with the Blacksburg Middle School students at their school for the remainder of the year. It was determined that repair costs would exceed $18 million and would not be feasible given the age of the school; it was decided not to repair the building. Before the school year of 2013-14 Blacksburg High School was operating on a normal schedule out of the Blacksburg Middle School building on 3109 Prices Fork Road, and the middle schoolers were going to school in the old Christiansburg Middle School. The original Blacksburg High School building was vacant until it was demolished in the Summer of 2011. The newly constructed school building of Blacksburg High School which opened for the 2013 fall semester is located at 3401 Bruin Lane, behind the current Blacksburg Middle School and Bill Brown Football Stadium.[7]
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 19.89 square miles (51.5 km2) of which 19.89 square miles (51.5 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2), or 0.10%, is water. At 2,080 feet (634 m) above sea level, Blacksburg is located in the New River Valley and also sits astride the Eastern Continental Divide. It is the 15th largest municipality[27] and the largest town in the commonwealth of Virginia.[28] The Eastern Continental Divide traverses the Virginia Tech Montgomery Executive Airport.
The tallest building in Blacksburg is Slusher Tower, a twelve-story residence hall on the Virginia Tech campus. The building with the highest elevation is actually Hoge Hall (formerly Lee Hall), another residence hall, which until May 17, 2009, was home to the transmitter of campus radio station WUVT. The tower for WUVT now sits atop Price Mountain.[29]
Due to its elevation, the climate of Blacksburg is a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfa), being cooled down from the lowland areas, all of which possess a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). Summers are humid with warm to hot temperatures, although the area sees significantly cooler temperatures than places of lower elevation at the same latitude, with only 5 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs annually.[30] Winters are generally cool to cold, with occasional intervening warm periods and an average of 0.9 nights of sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows.[30] Monthly mean temperatures range from 31.9 °F (−0.1 °C) in January to 71.7 °F (22.1 °C) in July. Snowfall averages 24.7 inches (63 cm) per season and generally occurs from December to March, although significant snowfall has been recorded outside of those months.
Blacksburg is served primarily by US 460, a four-lane highway that connects I-81 at Christiansburg, 10 miles to the south, and to I-77 at Princeton, West Virginia. Driving from Blacksburg to its larger metro neighbor, Roanoke, via US 460 and I-81, usually requires less than an hour. 
Blacksburg Transit (BT) provides bus transportation primarily to and from the campus of Virginia Tech. Students and faculty ride the BT fare free with a flat payment included in the cost of tuition. Virginia Tech subsidizes BT for this service. Transportation is available to anyone for a fee, and during special events the service is often free. Blacksburg Transit also offers shuttle service to non-students on Virginia Tech Football game days for $5 to be transported from outlying parking areas to the stadium.[32]
The Smart Way Bus, a regional commuter bus service operated by Valley Metro (Roanoke), provides connecting service between Virginia Tech, downtown Blacksburg, Christiansburg, Roanoke–Blacksburg Regional Airport, and Roanoke, where riders can transfer to an Amtrak train.
At nearby Roanoke–Blacksburg Regional Airport, there are scheduled commercial flights to Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago–O'Hare, New York–LaGuardia, Orlando/Sanford, Philadelphia, St. Petersburg/Clearwater, and Washington–Dulles, and there are seasonal charter flights to Atlantic City.
Virginia Tech Montgomery Executive Airport, located in the Town of Blacksburg, has general aviation, air taxi, and military flights.
As of the 2020 U.S. census,[34] there were 44,826 people residing in the town.
As of the 2000 census,[3] there were 39,573 people, 13,162 households, and 4,777 families residing in the town. The population density was 2,044.2 people per square mile (789.2/km2). There were 13,732 housing units at an average density of 709.4 per square mile (273.9/km2).

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.32% of the population.
There were 13,162 households, out of which 16.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.7% were married couples living together, 5.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 63.7% were non-families. 26.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.37 and the average family size was 2.79.
In the town, the population was spread out, with 9.7% under the age of 18, 57.4% from 18 to 24, 18.9% from 25 to 44, 9.2% from 45 to 64, and 4.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 127.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 129.7 males.

The Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which includes the town of Christiansburg, the independent city of Radford, and all of Montgomery, Pulaski, and Giles counties has an estimated population of 181,863 and is currently one of the faster-growing MSAs in Virginia.
About 87% of the town's residents have in-home Internet access with 65% using a broadband connection.[27] Eighty-five percent of the community has a college education,[27] seventy percent of which were graduates of Virginia Tech.
The Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center is home to several companies of varying sizes including Honeywell, and the National Weather Service which maintains its Southwestern Virginia headquarters there. The town is also home to MOOG, a major supplier for the defense department and the health care industry and Rackspace, who acquired locally based Mailtrust/Webmail.us in 2007. The town and county continue to recruit major industry to the area. Due to its close proximity to Virginia Tech and Radford University, Blacksburg is an ideal location for developing high tech industry.
According to Blacksburg's 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report,[35] the top employers in the town are:
Blacksburg is governed by a Town Council of six members and a mayor. Elections take place in odd-numbered years, in November. Council members are elected for four-year terms. The town’s mayor is an elected office. Leslie Hager-Smith was first elected mayor in 2017 and was re-elected in 2021.
Blacksburg's sister city is San José de Bocay, in the mountains of northern Nicaragua.[47][48]
The Virginia Tech Hokies are the athletic teams representing Virginia Tech in intercollegiate athletics. The Hokies participate in the NCAA's Division I Atlantic Coast Conference in 22 varsity sports. Virginia Tech's men's sports are football, basketball, baseball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, indoor and outdoor track and field, and wrestling. Virginia Tech's women's sports are basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, indoor and outdoor track and field, golf, and volleyball.
Virginia Tech's individual athletes have won 21 individual national titles in various track and field events, wrestling, and swimming. Though not affiliated with the NCAA, Virginia Tech won the 2007 national championship of bass fishing.[2] The Hokie men's basketball team won the 1973 and 1995 NIT tournaments and went to the Sweet Sixteen of NCAA tournament in 1967 and 2019. The Hokies football team lost to Florida State in the 2000 Sugar Bowl (BCS National Championship Game) and finished the 1999 season with a #2 ranking in the BCS Poll.
Virginia Tech's sports teams are called the "Hokies". The word "Hokie" originated in the "Old Hokie" spirit yell created in 1896 by O. M. Stull for a contest to select a new spirit yell when the college's name was changed from Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (VAMC) to Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute (VPI) and the original spirit yell, which referred to the old name, was no longer usable. Stull won, and received a $5 award.
Hoki, Hoki, Hoki, Hy.
Techs, Techs, VPI!
Sola-Rex, Sola-Rah.
Polytechs—Vir-gin-ia.
Rae, Ri, V.P.I
Later, the phrase "Team! Team! Team!" was added at the end, and an "e" was added to "Hoki".
Stull later said that he made up the word as an attention-grabber. Though he may not have known it, "Hokie" (in its various forms) has been around at least since 1842. According to Johann Norstedt, now a retired Virginia Tech English professor, "[Hokie was] a word that people used to express feeling, approval, excitement, surprise. Hokie, then, is a word like 'hooray' or 'yeah', or 'rah'." Whatever its original meaning, the word in the popular cheer did, as Stull wanted, grab attention and has been a part of Virginia Tech tradition ever since.[3]
The official university school colors—Chicago Maroon and Burnt Orange—also were introduced in 1896. The colors were chosen by a committee because they made a "unique combination" not worn elsewhere at the time.[4]
The team mascot is the HokieBird, a turkey-like creature. The teams were originally known as the "Fighting Gobblers" and the turkey motif was retained despite the name change.
The stylized VT (the abbreviation for Virginia Tech) is used primarily by the athletic department as a symbol for Virginia Tech athletic teams. The "athletic VT" symbol is trademarked by the university and appears frequently on licensed merchandise.
During the early years of the university, a rivalry developed between the Virginia Military Institute and Virginia Tech, then called VPI. This rivalry developed into the original "Military Classic of the South," which was an annual football game between VMI and VPI on Thanksgiving Day in Roanoke, Virginia. This rivalry continued until 1970 when Tech's football program became too large and too competitive for VMI. Today, Tech's major athletic rivalries include the Virginia Cavaliers (see Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry), the West Virginia Mountaineers, and the Miami Hurricanes.
Virginia Tech's fight song, Tech Triumph, was written in 1919 and remains in use today. Tech Triumph is played at sporting events by both the Virginia Tech band, The Marching Virginians, and the Corps of Cadets' band, the Highty Tighties. The Old Hokie spirit yell, in use since 1896, is familiar to all Tech fans.
Many of Tech's more modern traditions were adopted after the construction of Lane Stadium in 1964. Virginia Tech's football traditions and the school's fans are the subject of a 2007 full-length documentary called Hokie Nation[5] which features a mix of interviews with coaches, players and fans as well as a look at Hokie football history and the direction of the program.
Tech teams participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), which the school joined in 2003 after a tumultuous trek through five different conferences in the previous decade, most recently leaving the Big East in the controversial ACC expansion.
In 1921, Virginia Tech joined the Southern Intercollegiate Conference (now Southern Conference), which contained 19 schools by 1922, all current members of the ACC or Southeastern Conference (SEC). In 1932, thirteen schools left the then-gigantic Southern Conference to form the SEC and in 1953, seven more teams left to form the ACC.[7]
Frank Moseley, Virginia Tech's director of athletics and football coach, believed that the new Southern Conference was a lower tier of competition and sought membership in the ACC, but was turned down. In 1965, Tech left the Southern Conference to become independent. In 1977, Virginia Tech once again sought admission to the ACC and was once again rejected.[8]
In 1978, Virginia Tech joined the Metro Conference, winning the conference men's basketball championship in their first year.
In 1991, Virginia Tech was invited to join the Big East Conference for football only. Members of the Big East football conference included Boston College, Miami, Pittsburgh, Rutgers, Syracuse, Temple, Virginia Tech, and West Virginia.[9]  In 1994, Virginia Tech was turned down for full membership in the Big East.[10]
In January 1995, Virginia Tech and Virginia Commonwealth University were ousted from the Metro Conference and subsequently filed a lawsuit against the conference.[11]  The lawsuit was settled when Metro agreed to pay the Hokies $1,135,000 and Virginia Tech joined the Atlantic 10 Conference, along with fellow newcomers Dayton and LaSalle in June 1995.[12]
In 1999, the Big East agreed to accept Virginia Tech as a full member in all sports. Virginia Tech ultimately paid $8.3 million to join the conference, $1.1 million of which was actually paid after the school left.[13]
In April 2003, Mike Tranghese, commissioner of the Big East, dropped a bombshell — that the ACC was secretly trying to lure away Big East members.[14]  Over the next several months, the ACC held meetings and discussions. Ultimately, Virginia Tech was invited to join the conference, along with Miami. Boston College was added the following year. Virginia Tech finally had achieved what Frank Moseley had sought so long ago — membership in the ACC.
When Virginia Tech was invited to join the ACC, former Roanoke Times sports editor Bill Brill expressed his displeasure, saying "Virginia Tech will not win an ACC championship in my lifetime."[15] When Virginia Tech's football team proceeded to do precisely that in their very first season in the league, Brill's house in Chapel Hill, North Carolina received hundreds of mocking phone calls from angry Virginia Tech fans, curious to learn when the funeral arrangements would be held.[16]
Virginia Tech's football team plays home games in Lane Stadium. With a capacity of 66,233, Lane is relatively small in comparison to many other top FBS stadiums, yet it is still considered to be one of the loudest stadiums in the country. In 2005, it was recognized by rivals.com as having the best home-field advantage in college football.[17]
Since the 1995 season, the Hokies have finished with a top-10 ranking five times, won seven conference championships (three Big East and four ACC), and played once for the national championship, losing to Florida State 46–29 in the 2000 Sugar Bowl. Annually, Virginia Tech plays its traditional rival, the University of Virginia, for the Commonwealth Cup, a series which Virginia Tech leads 59-38-5.[18]
Frank Beamer was the Hokies' head coach from 1987 to 2015, and was the winningest active head coach in FBS football with 280 wins following the 2015 season. Coach Beamer ended his tenure as head coach with a win in the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, LA, where the Bowl streak began in 1993.[19] Beamer's teams were known for solid special teamsplay (called "Beamer Ball") and for tough defenses headed by defensive coordinator Bud Foster. In 2018, Beamer was selected to join the 2018 College Football Hall of Fame.[20]
On November 29, 2015, Virginia Tech Director of Athletics Whit Babcock announced that Justin Fuente was hired from the University of Memphis to succeed the retiring Frank Beamer. In Fuente's first season, Virginia Tech won the ACC Coastal Division and he was named the ACC Coach of the Year.[21]
Virginia Tech's men's basketball team plays home games in Cassell Coliseum. They have enjoyed moderate success in the postseason, making the NCAA Tournament 11 times.
Virginia Tech's men's basketball team saw a resurgence of fan support since the arrival of coach Seth Greenberg in 2003–04 and the university's entry into the ACC in 2004–05. Prior to Coach Greenberg's arrival in Blacksburg, the men's basketball team had not had a winning season since the 1995–96 season, when they received a bid to the NCAA tournament.
In 2003–04, Greenberg's squad made the Big East tournament. A year later, in their first season in the ACC, the Hokies scored their first postseason berth in nine years when they made the NIT in 2004–05. In the 2006–07 season, Greenberg's Hokies finished with a 10–6 record in the ACC and a 22–12 record overall, earning their first NCAA tournament berth in 11 years, reaching the NCAA second round before losing to Southern Illinois.
In March 2014, Virginia Tech Director of Athletics Whit Babcock announced the hiring of Buzz Williams as the Hokies' new head men's basketball coach. Williams spent the previous six seasons as the head coach at Marquette University, where he compiled a 139–69 record and led the Golden Eagles to five NCAA appearances and a Big East Conference regular season title. During Williams's tenure, Marquette tallied a 69–39 record in the Big East Conference, and six Marquette players made it to the NBA.[22]
In the Buzz Williams era, Virginia Tech made NCAA Men's Tournament appearances in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 seasons, making it the first time in school history that Virginia Tech has made the NCAA Men's Tournament three years in a row. In the 2019 NCAA Tournament, Virginia Tech advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 1967.
In April 2019, Whit Babcock announced the hiring of Mike Young after Buzz Williams left to become the head coach at Texas A&M. On March 12, 2022, Young led the Hokies to the ACC Tournament title for the first time in school history.[23] The tournament final was played against Mike Krzyzewski's Duke Blue Devils in Coach K's final ACC tournament game. Tech, the seven seed, won 82-67 and only reached the final after beating Clemson, Notre Dame, and North Carolina in consecutive nights. The Hokies were the first seven seed to win the tournament in its long history.
Virginia Tech's women's basketball team is led by coach Kenny Brooks and competes in the ACC. Under former coaches Beth Dunkenberger and Bonnie Henrickson, the program was a fixture in postseason play. The Hokies have received nine berths to the NCAA tournament since the program's first in 1994. Virginia Tech's women have also earned five NIT appearances during that stretch including back-to-back appearances in 2016 and 2017.[24] They play their home games in Cassell Coliseum.
Women's soccer at Virginia Tech began in 1980 with two club teams under the guidance of Everett Germain and his two daughters, Betsy and Julie. Kelly Cagle was head coach from 2002 to 2010, leaving with a record of 76–70–15 and three consecutive NCAA trips. She was succeeded by Charles "Chugger" Adair.[25] Under Adair the Hokie Women's Soccer quad has spent numerous weeks ranked in the top 25 during their 2012 campaign. During the 2013 season Virginia Tech ranked in the top 5 making it to the Final Four for the first time in school history.[26] The women's team has now been to 6 straight NCAA tournaments 2008–2013 having two Sweet Sixteen finishes and one Final Four finish.
Virginia Tech's men's soccer team has improved greatly since the arrival of Oliver Weiss, who has coached the team since 2000. Under Weiss, Tech has made four NCAA tournament appearances, including a trip to the College Cup in 2007. The Hokies' trip to the College Cup is the equivalent of men's basketball Final Four and was the soccer team's most successful season. The Hokies finished the 2007 regular season ranked third nationally.[27]
Chuck Hartman, who retired as the Virginia Tech baseball coach in 2006, finished his career as the fourth winningest coach in Division I baseball history with a 1,444–816–8 record, including a 961–591–18 mark in his 28 seasons at Tech, the best record of any baseball coach in history at Tech.
The team is currently coached by John Szefc.[28]
Since starting its varsity program in 1996, the Virginia Tech softball team has played in six conference championship games, winning both the ACC regular season and tournament titles in 2007.[29] Under head coach Scot Thomas and behind the strength of one of the nation's best college pitchers, senior All-American Angela Tincher,[30] the Hokies made their fourth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance in 2008. On May 25, 2008, they defeated the fourth-seeded Michigan Wolverines to advance to their first College World Series, though the Hokies were held scoreless during that appearance and were quickly eliminated in two games.[31] Virginia Tech Softball upset the USA national team in a 1–0 no hitter in 2008[32] and advanced to the Women's College World Series for the first time ever.[33] Scot Thomas helped start the program in 1996 and celebrated his 600th win during the 2012 season. He was fired following the conclusion of the 2018 season after two consecutive losing seasons.
Since joining the ACC, the Virginia Tech Softball team has won two Conference Titles in 2007 and 2008. On May 31, 2018, Pete D'Amour was announced as the new head coach of the Virginia Tech softball program.[34]
The men's golf team has won 12 conference championships:[35]
In 2007, Virginia Tech golfer Drew Weaver became the first American to win the British Amateur golf tournament since 1979. Weaver edged out 2006 Australian Amateur champion Tim Stewart and earned an invitation to the 2007 Open Championship.
Former Hokies that have won at the professional level include: Johnson Wagner (three PGA Tour wins), Adam Hunter (one European Tour win), and Brendon de Jonge (one Nationwide Tour win).
The Virginia Tech Wrestling program was founded in 1920. The team holds its matches at Cassell Coliseum and practices in the training room on the third floor of the football locker room facility, renovated in 2010.[36]
In 2006, Kevin Dresser was named the head coach of the wrestling program. The team won the 2014 ACC Tournament, led by captain Devin Carter, who was named Tournament MVP. The Hokies finished 8th overall in team standings at the 2014 NCAA Championships. Devin Carter was the runner-up at 141 lbs and Virginia Tech's first ever NCAA Tournament finalist.[37]
During the 2014–15 season, a few select matches were held for the first time at the Moss Performing Arts Center on the Virginia Tech campus.
The Hokie Wrestling team won the 2015–16 regular season ACC dual meet title, after beating previously undefeated North Carolina State University in the last conference dual meet of the season. The team took second place at the 2016 ACC Tournament. The 2015–16 team also set program bests with six All-Americans and a fourth-place finish at the 2016 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships, which is also the highest team finish for an ACC team ever. Kevin Dresser was named the 2016 NWCA Coach of the Year at the tournament.[37]
In 2017, Tony Robie became the wrestling program's head coach, following Kevin Dresser's departure to Iowa State.
In 2019, redshirt freshman Mekhi Lewis became the first Hokie wrestler to win a national championship for Virginia Tech. Before his 7–1 victory over two-time defending national champion Vincenzo Joseph of Penn State in the 165-pound finals, Lewis dispatched the number one seed Alex Marinelli of Iowa in the quarterfinals and the number four seed Evan Wick of Wisconsin in the semi-finals. For his remarkable three-day performance, Lewis was named Most Outstanding Wrestler of the tournament.
Virginia Tech Ice Hockey was formed in 1984. They joined the newly formed ACCHL in 1995 and have competed there ever since. The team won the regular season champion title during the 1996–97 season with a record of 13–1. The Hokies play out of the Berglund Center in Roanoke and drew the biggest crowd in team history of 5,200+ to the VT vs. UVA game on January 19, 2007. They became the first non-Carolina team to win the Canes Cup on January 14, 2007 by defeating the Duke University Blue Devils, NC State University Wolfpack and the East Carolina University Pirates. During the 2010–2011 season, the Hokies turned towards a more competitive conference, the Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Hockey Association (MACHA), where they play in the same division against Liberty, East Carolina, Maryland, and UMBC. In the 2011–2012 season, the Hokies earned a berth in the ACHA Division II National Tournament for the first time in program history, finishing 12th in the nation.  The Hokies captured their first MACH championship in 2013 by defeating (3) Liberty, (2) UMBC, and (1) Penn State in succession.
The Virginia Tech rugby team was founded in 1968, although the first recorded college rugby match in Blacksburg dates back to 1891.[38] Virginia Tech rugby plays in the Big East conference against its traditional ACC rivals. Tech rugby plays an annual rivalry match against University of Virginia for the Commonwealth Shield.[39] The Hokies are supported by the Tech Rugby Alumni Association, which has established an endowment managed by the Virginia Tech Foundation that provides for limited scholarships for rugby players.[40] The Hokies are led by head coach Carlos Dominguez.
The Hokies have been successful in rugby sevens. The Hokies finished third in their conference in spring 2012.[41] The Hokies won the college division of the July 2012 Cape Fear 7s tournament.[42] The Hokies also defeated other ACC teams to win the 2012 Virginia Tech 7s, beating NC State 22–5 in the final.[43] In 2012, the Hokies defeated Virginia 33-31 to win the Atlantic Coast Rugby League 7s, automatically qualifying for the 2012 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships. Winning the 2012 ARRL 7s also qualified the Hokies for the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship, the highest profile competition in college rugby, broadcast live on NBC from PPL Park in Philadelphia.
The Hokies claimed the 2021 D1-AA National Championship with a dominant tournament run featuring wins over Salisbury (91-0), Boise State (27-11), and West Chester (37-15). The following year, they repeated as champions, defeating the Louisville Cardinals in the 2022 D1-AA Championship Final (24-22).[44]
The Virginia Tech College Bass team was founded in the 2006–2007 school year, and won their first national title that same year.[45]
The Virginia Tech Club Field Hockey team was founded as a replacement of the D1 team in the 1990s. The team competes in the club-level National Field Hockey League, and won the league's championship in fall 2017.[46]
Virginia Tech, along with Kansas State and UCF, is one of only three Power Five conference schools that have not won an NCAA-recognized national championship in any varsity team sport.[47][a] The Hokies listed below have won individual National Championships.

الجامعة والمعهد التقني لولاية فيرجينيا معروفة باسم: فيرجينيا التقنية Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University أو Virginia Tech.[13] هي جامعة بحثية عامة، يقع مقرها الرئيسي في بلاكسبرج، فيرجينيا. تُدرس كل أنواع التكنولوجيا لها العديد من الأقسام منها: الفلاحة والهندسة. أنشأت عام 1872.[14]
تقدم الجامعة 280 برنامجًا لشهادة البكالوريوس والدراسات العليا لحوالي 34,400 طالب وتدير محفظة بحثية بقيمة 522 مليون دولار، مما يجعلها في المرتبة 46 بين الجامعات في الولايات المتحدة من حيث نفقات البحث.[15][16] تُعد الجامعة ثاني أكبر جامعة عامة في الولاية من حيث التسجيل.[17] وقع أعنف إطلاق نار جماعي في حرم جامعي أمريكي في الحرم الجامعي في عام 2007، حيث قتل أحد الطلاب خلاله 32 شخصًا من الطلبة وأعضاء الهيئة التدريسية وأصاب 23 آخرين.
في عام 1872، وبتمويل اتحادي قدمه قانون موريل لعام 1862، اشترت الجمعية العامة لفيرجينيا مرافق معهد بريستون وأولين، وهي مدرسة ميثودية صغيرة للبنين في مقاطعة مونتغومري الريفية بجنوب غرب فيرجينيا. وفي نفس العام، اشترت حوالي 250 أكر (100 ها) من مزرعة سوليتيود المجاورة مقابل 21,250 دولارًا من روبرت تايلور بريستون، ابن حاكم فرجينيا، جيمس باتون بريستون.[18][19] أدرج الكومنولث مؤسسة جديدة في الموقع، وهو معهد عسكري لمنح الأراضي مدعوم من الدولة يدعى كلية فيرجينيا الزراعية والميكانيكية.[20]
يُعد أديسون كالدويل أول طالب تم تسجيله في الجامعة في 1 أكتوبر 1872، حيث كان يسير لمسافة تزيد عن 25 ميلاً من منزله في مقاطعة كريج، فيرجينيا. وُضع له تمثال يقع في الجزء العلوي من الحرم الجامعي لإحياء ذكرى رحلته للتسجيل.[21] يعيد طلاب السنة الأولى وكادرهم التدريبي تمثيل رحلة أديسون كالدويل كل عام في كالدويل مارس. يكملون النصف الأول من مسيرة 26 ميلًا في الخريف والنصف الثاني في الربيع.[22]
خدم الرؤساء الخمسة الأوائل لكلية فيرجينيا الزراعية والميكانيكية في جيش الولايات الكونفدرالية أو الحكومة الكونفدرالية خلال الحرب الأهلية كما فعل العديد من أساتذتها الأوائل بما في ذلك القائد الأول، جيمس إتش لين، خريج معهد فرجينيا العسكري والجنرال الكونفدرالي السابق الذي قام بالتدريس الهندسة المدنية والتجارة في الكلية وهي تحمل اسم لين هول، أحد أقدم المباني في الحرم الجامعي الذي تم بناؤه عام 1888.[23]
كان رئيسها الثالث، توماس نيلسون كونراد، جاسوسًا كونفدراليًا سيئ السمعة أدار عملية سرية لجمع المعلومات الاستخباراتية من منزل في قلب واشنطن العاصمة ، وشملت مآثره في زمن الحرب، ومن بين أمور أخرى، قام بالتخطيط لمؤامرة لاغتيال القائد العام لجيش الولايات المتحدة وينفيلد سكوت.[24] كان رئيسها السادس الذي يحمل اسم بارينجر هول، بول براندون بارينجر، نجل الكونفدرالية الجنرال روفوس بارينجر وابن شقيق الجنرالات الكونفدرالية ستونوول جاكسون ودانييل هارفي هيل.
في عام 1953، تحت قيادة الرئيس والتر ستيفنسون نيومان، قبلت الجامعة طالبًا أسودًا للدراسة فيها لأول مرة حيث كانت تُعد مؤسسة عامة بيضاء تاريخيًا، وتم قبول ثلاثة طلاب سود آخرين في عام 1954. في ذلك الوقت كانت فرجينيا لا تزال تطبق قوانين جيم كرو وتمارس الفصل العنصري إلى حد كبير في التعليم العام والخاص، والكنائس والأحياء والمطاعم ودور السينما، ولم يُسمح لهؤلاء الطلاب السود الأوائل في الجامعة بالعيش في قاعات الإقامة أو تناول الطعام في قاعات الطعام في الحرم الجامعي. بدلاً من ذلك، استقلوا مع عائلات أمريكية من أصل أفريقي في بلاكسبرج. في عام 1958، دخل تشارلي ل. ييتس التاريخ كأول أمريكي من أصل أفريقي يتخرج من الجامعة. حصل ييتس على درجة البكالوريوس في الهندسة الميكانيكية مع مرتبة الشرف، وتم الترحيب به كأول أمريكي من أصل أفريقي "يتخرج من أي معهد هندسي كبير في الجنوب"، وفقًا لتقارير إخبارية في ذلك الوقت.[25]
مارشال هان، رئيس الجامعة في ذلك الحين، والذي امتدت فترة ولايته من 1962 إلى 1974،[26] كان مسؤولاً عن العديد من البرامج والسياسات التي حولت الجامعة من معهد عسكري صغير، أبيض تاريخيًا، ويغلب عليه الذكور مع التركيز الأساسي على التدريس الجامعي إلى جامعة بحثية مختلطة كبرى. زاد عدد الطلاب الذي كان يبلغ حوالي 5,682 في عام 1962 بحوالي 1,000 طالب كل عام، وتم تشييد مساكن ومباني أكاديمية جديدة، وأضيف أعضاء هيئة التدريس - في عام 1966، على سبيل المثال، انضم أكثر من 100 أستاذ جديد إلى الكلية - وازدادت ميزانيات البحث. خلال فترة هان، لم تكتف الجامعة بتخريج أول باحث من منحة روديس عام 1963،[27] وقامت بإلغاء شرط مشاركة الطلاب الذكور في فيلق كاديت لمدة عامين في عام 1964. ابتداءً من خريف عام 1973، تمكنت النساء من المشاركة في الفيلق، مما جعل الجامعة من بين الكليات العسكرية العليا الأولى في البلاد التي تدمج النساء.[28]
حتى عام 1932، كان يُطلب من كل رجل قادر جسديًا المشاركة لمدة أربع سنوات في فيلق فرجينيا التقنية من الكاديت. تم تغيير الشرط إلى عامين حتى عام 1964، عندما أصبحت المشاركة طوعية. أعضاء برنامج تدريب ضباط الاحتياط مطلوب منهم المشاركة في فيلق الكاديت. ظلت الجامعة واحدة من ثلاث جامعات عامة في الولايات المتحدة بها فيلق نشط من الطلاب العسكريين وطلاب مدنيين منتظمين في حرمها الجامعي (جامعة تكساس إيه آند إم وجامعة شمال جورجيا هما الآخران).
تُعرف فرق الجامعة باسم هوكيز، وهو مخلوق يشبه الديك الرومي.
من بين الرياضيين البارزين في الجامعة نيكيل ألكسندر ووكر، فرانك بيمر، آلان بريستو، كام تشانسيلور، بيمبو كولز، ديل كاري، آيس كوستيس، رينيه دينيس، بيل دولي، جيم دروكنميلر، تيريل إدموندز، تريمين إدموندز، بود فوستر، كيندال فولر، كايل فولر، وتشاك هارتمان، وسالي مايلز، وتشارلز موير، وجوني أوتس، وبروس سميث، وتيرود تايلور، ودي أنجيلو هول، وإشعيا فورد، وأنجيلا تينشر، ومايكل فيك.[32]

أبرز المرافق الرياضية هي ملعب لين، وكاسيل كوليسيوم، والميدان الإنجليزي، وتومسون فيلد، وتيك سوفتبول بارك، وريكتور فيلد هاوس، ومرفق بيمر لوسون للتمرين الداخلي، ومركز كريستيانسبورغ المائي.كاسيل كوليسيوم

L'Institut Politècnic i Universitat Estatal de Virgínia (en anglès: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) conegut com a Virginia Tech, és una universitat pública situada a Blacksburg (Estats Units). Les seves titulacions en enginyeries, arquitectura, veterinària, administració pública i silvicultura destaquen especialment.
En 1872 l'Assemblea General de Virgínia va adquirir les propietats d'una petita escola metodista del Comtat de Montgomery cridada Institut Olin i Preston i va fundar l'acadèmia militar Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College. En 1896 la institució va passar a denominar-se Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute, i en 1944 es va canviar a Virginia Polytechnic Institute, adoptant el nom actual de Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University en 1970.
Virginia Tech ofereix 225 titulacions: 65 programes de grau i 160 de postgrau (màsters i doctorats) en les seves facultats i escoles.
El campus de Virginia Tech inclou 130 edificis en aproximadament 2.600 acres de terreny, entre els quals es troben les 29 residències universitàries que alberguen més de 9.000 estudiants. Tots els alumnes de primer any estan obligats a viure al campus.
Virginia Tech és una potència esportiva de primer nivell en la Divisió I de la NCAA, on competeix en la Atlantic Coast Conference.
El 16 d'abril de 2007 es va produir una massacre al campus universitari, quan el sud-coreà Seung-Hui Cho va assassinar 32 persones abans de suïcidar-se. Els fets van tenir lloc en la residència West Ambler Johnston Hall i a l'edifici Norris Hall Engineering Building.
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, známá pod jménem Virginia Tech, je státní polytechnická univerzita podporovaná státem v Blacksburgu ve Virginii ve Spojených státech. Ačkoliv je to komplexní univerzita s mnoha fakultami, za nejsilnější jsou stále považovány zemědělský, inženýrský, architektonický, lesnický program a program veterinárního lékařství, protože se týkají již z historie polytechnického jádra univerzity.
Virginia Tech byla založena jako vojenská univerzita a je jednou z mála státních univerzit ve Spojených státech, které pokračuje ve výchově kadetů (plnohodnotný vojenský tréninkový program). Virginia Tech je jednou z šesti seniorských vojenských univerzit (pět je státních, jedna soukromá) díky původu a přítomnosti kadetů.

Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (besser bekannt als Virginia Tech) ist eine staatliche, technische Universität in Blacksburg, USA und die größte Universität im US-Bundesstaat Virginia. Hier wurde 2004 ein Supercomputer namens System X zusammengestellt.
1872 wurde die Universität als Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College gegründet. Ihr Name wurde 1896 in Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute und 1970 schließlich in Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University geändert. Seit einigen Jahren ist auch Virginia Tech eine offizielle Bezeichnung und wird heute öfter verwendet.
Am 16. April 2007 tötete ein Student bei zwei Schießereien auf dem Campus der Virginia Tech 32 Menschen und sich selbst. Siehe dazu den Hauptartikel Amoklauf an der Virginia Tech.
Am 8. Dezember 2011 wurden bei einer Schießerei ein Polizist und ein weiterer Mensch getötet. Der Täter befindet sich auf der Flucht.[3]
Die Universität besteht aus folgenden Colleges:
In Klammern ist die Zahl der eingeschriebenen Studenten angegeben (Stand: 2014/2015). 1.761 weitere Studenten haben an mehreren Colleges gleichzeitig studiert.[4]
Studenten, welche eine militärische Laufbahn anstreben, können, zusätzlich zum Studium, eine Ausbildung zum Offizier im Kadettenkorps erhalten. Mit der Gründung im Jahre 1872 als Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College einer Land-grant University war die militärische Ausbildung und die Zugehörigkeit zum Kadettenkorps verpflichtend. 1923 wurde die verpflichtende Dauer im Kadettenkorps von vier auf zwei Jahre reduziert. Die Studenten konnten danach als zivile Studenten weiter die Hochschule besuchen. Veteranen nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg mussten kein Mitglied im Korps werden. Im Jahre 1964 wurde die Aufnahme ins Korps freiwillig.[5]
Heute ist die Mitgliedschaft im Corps of Cadets und die Teilnahme am Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) nicht mehr notwendig. Die Mitgliedschaft und die Teilnahme am ROTC ist jedoch eine Voraussetzung, um mit Abschluss an der Hochschule ein Offizierspatent (Commission) zu erhalten. Die Kadetten sind keine Soldaten, gehören nicht zu den US-Streitkräften und unterliegen damit nicht der Militärgerichtsbarkeit. Sie sind jedoch verpflichtet Uniform zu tragen, leben gemeinsam in Unterkünften und unterliegen militärischen Drill und den Regeln der militärischen Disziplin. Studenten, die eine militärische Karriere anstreben müssen als Kadett am ROTC teilnehmen (englisch Military Leader Track) und unterliegen der Pflicht zum späteren Militärdienst, alternativ erhalten sie eine zusätzliche Ausbildung zur zivilen Führungskraft (englisch Citizen-Leader Track).[6] Mehr als 75 % der Kadetten streben das Offizierspatent an. Als Mitglieder eines Senior Military College erhalten diese Absolventen des Kadettenkorps das Recht als aktiver Offizier in den US-Streitkräften zu dienen.
Das Kadettenkorps bietet das ROTC Programmen von US Army, US Air Force und US Navy an, in denen die Führungspositionen durch Kadetten der oberen Jahrgänge besetzt werden. Als Besonderheit gibt es ein eigenes militärisches Musikkorps und eine berittene Einheit.[7]
Der Undergraduate-Studiengang Architektur wurde im Jahr 2017 als der fünftbeste des Landes eingestuft.[8] Namhafte Architekten, die die Schule hervorgebracht hat, sind:
Zu den Lehrenden zählt gegenwärtig u. a. Markus Breitschmid.[9] Eine bedeutende Emerita war Milka Bliznakov.
Die Sportteams des Virginia Techs nennen sich die Hokies. Die Universität ist Mitglied der Atlantic Coast Conference.
Es gibt 213 Gebäude und einen Flughafen (Virginia Tech Montgomery Executive Airport, eröffnet 1931).[2]

El Instituto Politécnico y Universidad Estatal de Virginia (VPISU) (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University en inglés), conocido como Virginia Tech (VT o VPI), es una universidad pública ubicada en Blacksburg (Estados Unidos). Tiene facilidades educativos en seis regiones por todo el estado y un sitio de estudiar en el extranjero ubicado en Riva San Vitale, Suiza. A través de la programa de cuerpos de cadets, Virginia Tech también esta designado como uno de seis colegios militares mayores en los Estados Unidos. 
Virginia Tech ofrece 280 programas de universitario y postgrado a unos 34.400 estudiantes y mantiene un portafolio de investigación de $522 millones. Es en el cuarenta y seis lugar entre las universidades en los Estados Unidos por gastos de investigación y la única universidad ubicada en Virginia entre los 50 mejores. Virginia Tech también es la segunda universidad pública más grande del estado por el número de inscriptos. El tiroteo más letal en un campus de una universidad estadounidense ocurrió en campus aquí en 2007. Sus titulaciones en ingenierías, arquitectura, veterinaria, administración pública y silvicultura destacan especialmente.
En 1872 la Asamblea General de Virginia adquirió las propiedades de una pequeña escuela metodista del Condado de Montgomery llamada Instituto Olin y Preston y fundó la academia militar Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College. En 1896 la institución pasó a denominarse Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute, y en 1944 se cambió a Virginia Polytechnic Institute, adoptando el nombre actual de Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University en 1970.
Virginia Tech ofrece 225 titulaciones: 65 programas de grado y 160 de postgrado (másteres y doctorados) en sus facultades y escuelas.
El campus de Virginia Tech está ubicado en Blacksburg, Virginia. El campus central esta rodeado por Prices Fork Road al noroeste, Plantation Drice al oeste, Main Street al este, y US 406 Bypass al sur, aunque tiene algunos kilómetros más afuera de eso.  
En la mitad del campus esta situado el "Drillfield", un campo oval cercado por una calle de sentido único llamada "Drillfield Drive". Se le dio ese nombre por su uso frecuente por el "Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets" para llevar a cabo entrenamientos millitares. Al noroeste lado se puede encontrar la mayoría de los edificios académicos y administrativos de la universidad, incluyendo los salas "Burrus" y "McBryde". Al sureste lado se encuentra la mayoría de los dormitorios, incluyendo las residencias universitarias, comedores, y el gymnasium de memorial de guerra. La Biblioteca de Newman está ubicada al este y se conecta al puente de Torgersen y cruza la calle principal del campus "Alumni Mall".
El campus de Virginia Tech incluye 130 edificios en aproximadamente 2,600 acres de terreno, entre los que se encuentran las 29 residencias universitarias que albergan más de 9.000 estudiantes. Todos los alumnos de primer año están obligados a vivir en el campus.
Virginia Tech es una potencia deportiva de primer nivel en la División I de la NCAA, donde compite en la Atlantic Coast Conference.
El 16 de abril de 2007 se produjo una masacre en el campus universitario, cuando el surcoreano Seung-Hui Cho asesinó a 32 personas antes de suicidarse. Los hechos tuvieron lugar en la residencia West Ambler Johnston Hall y en el edificio Norris Hall Engineering Building.

ویرجینیا تک (به انگلیسی: Virginia Tech) (مخفف انگلیسی: VT) که به‌طور رسمی دانشگاه ایالتی و مؤسسۀ پلی‌تکنیک ویرجینیا (به انگلیسی: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) خوانده می‌شود، یک دانشگاه تحقیقاتی دولتی و از معتبرترین دانشگاه‌های پلی‌تکنیک در کشور ایالات متحدۀ آمریکا است که در جنوب‌غربی ایالت ویرجینیا و در شهر بلکسبرگ قرار دارد. این دانشگاه یک مؤسسۀ دولتی است که در سال ۱۸۷۲ میلادی تأسیس شد. نام اولیه آن کالج کشاورزی و مکانیک ویرجینیا بود. دانشگاه ویرجینیا تک، پیش‌تر یک مؤسسۀ فنی نظامی در بلکسبرگ بود.
این دانشگاه پلی‌تکنیک حدود ۲۶٬۰۰۰ دانشجو دارد. دانشگاه ویرجینیا تک در سال ۱۸۷۲ به عنوان یک مدرسه نظامی تأسیس شد. این دانشگاه یکی از دانشگاه‌های خوب و خوش‌نام شرق ایالات متحده می‌باشد.
ویرجینیا تک ۲۸۰ دوره کارشناسی و کارشناسی ارشد را به حدود ۳۴۴۰۰ دانشجو ارائه می‌دهد و ۵۲۲ میلیون دلار پروژه تحقیقاتی را مدیریت می‌کند و این دانشگاه را برای دانشگاه در ایالات متحده برای هزینه‌های تحقیق در رتبه ۴۸ و دوم در منطقه مشترک‌المنافع ویرجینیا قرار می‌دهد. این دانشگاه در میان «R1: دانشگاه‌های دکترا - فعالیت تحقیقاتی بسیار بالا» طبقه‌بندی شده‌است.[۱] ویرجینیا تک، از نظر ثبت نام، دومین دانشگاه دولتی بزرگ ایالت است.[۲] مرگبارترین تیراندازی دسته جمعی در یک دانشگاه کالج آمریکایی در سال ۲۰۰۷ در دانشگاه رخ داد، در طی آن دانشجویی ۳۲ دانشجوی دیگر و اعضای هیئت علمی را به ضرب گلوله کشته و ۲۳ نفر دیگر را زخمی کرد.
در سال ۱۸۷۲، با بودجه فدرال تأمین شده توسط قانون موریل در سال ۱۸۶۲، مجمع عمومی ویرجینیا امکانات مؤسسه پرستون و اولین، یک مدرسه کوچک متدیسم برای پسران در شهرستان مونتگومری، ویرجینیا، روستایی در جنوب غربی ویرجینیا، را خریداری کرد. در همان سال، ۲۵۰ جریب (۱۰۰ هکتار) مزرعه از جمله خانه و چندین ساختمان مزرعه در این ملک با پرداخت ۲۱٬۲۵۰ دلار از رابرت تیلور پرستون، پسر فرماندار ویرجینیا، جیمز پاتون پرستون، خریداری شد.[۳][۴] ایالات مشترک‌المنافع یک مؤسسه جدید را در سایت گنجانیدند، یک دانشگاه نظامی با اعطای زمین به نام «کالج کشاورزی و مکانیک ویرجینیا».[۵]
هزینه تحقیق و توسعه ویرجینیا تک (تحقیق و توسعه) ۵۴۲ میلیون دلار در سال مالی ۲۰۱۹ بوده‌است که طبق بنیاد ملی علوم در رتبه ۴۸ در میان مؤسسات آموزشی در کشور و در رتبه ۲ در ایالت ویرجینیا قرار دارد.[۶] در نتیجه، ویرجینیا تک پانزدهمین سال متوالی رشد پژوهشی خود را رقم زد، با بیش از دو برابر شدن پروژه تحقیقاتی دانشگاه از ۱۹۲٫۷ میلیون دلار در سال مالی ۲۰۰۰. تنها مؤسسه ویرجینیا در ۵۰ رتبه برتر NSF برای هزینه‌های تحقیق، ویرجینیا تک است و رتبه ۲۳ در بین دانشگاه‌های دولتی آمریکا. هزینه‌های تحقیقاتی دانشگاه آن را در ۵ درصد بالای بیش از ۹۰۰ دانشگاه و کالج تحقیقاتی قرار می‌دهد. هر ساله، این دانشگاه هزاران جایزه برای انجام تحقیقات از یک پایگاه حامی مالی به‌طور مداوم دریافت می‌کند. محققان کشف‌های جدید در زمینه کشاورزی، بیوتکنولوژی، فناوری اطلاعات و ارتباطات، سلامت انسان، حمل و نقل، مدیریت انرژی (از جمله رهبری در فناوری سلول سوختی و الکترونیک قدرت)، امنیت، پایداری و طیف وسیعی از سایر علوم مهندسی، علمی، اجتماعی و زمینه‌های خلاق را دنبال می‌کنند. این تحقیق منجر به ۳۶ حق ثبت اختراع و ۱۷ توافق‌نامه مجوز و اختیار در سال مالی ۲۰۱۳ شد.[۷]
تیم‌های ویرجینیا تک به هوکی معروف هستند. HokieBird یک نوع بوقلمون است.

برنامه MBA پاره وقت کالج بازرگانی پامپلین در گزارش اخبار و جهان در سال ۲۰۲۰ در رتبه نوزدهم قرار گرفت. برنامه کارشناسی ارشد فناوری اطلاعات، که به‌طور مشترک توسط کالج بازرگانی پامپلین و دانشکده مهندسی حمایت مالی می‌شود، در بهترین برنامه‌های فناوری اطلاعات رایانه ای فارغ التحصیلان آنلاین اخبار و گزارش جهانی ایالات متحده در رتبه ۴ قرار دارد. این برنامه میان رشته‌ای کاملاً آنلاین ارائه می‌شود. 
برنامه‌های کالج معماری و مطالعات شهری (CAUS) شامل معماری + طراحی، معماری منظر، برنامه‌ریزی شهری و مدیریت دولتی است. هوش طراحی در گزارش «بهترین دانشکده‌های معماری و طراحی آمریکا» در سال ۲۰۱۶، برنامه معماری دوره کارشناسی را در بین دانشگاه‌های دولتی و خصوصی در رتبه ۳ در سطح ملی قرار داده‌است. برنامه معماری تحصیلات تکمیلی رتبه ۹ کشور را بدست آورد. برای سال ۲۰۱۳، هوش طراحی برنامه‌های معماری منظر دانشگاه در مقطع کارشناسی و کارشناسی ارشد را شماره ۲ در کشور قرار داده‌است. علاوه بر این، هوش طراحی برنامه طراحی داخلی دانشگاه در دوره کارشناسی را در رتبه ۶ و برنامه طراحی صنعتی در مقطع کارشناسی را در رتبه ۳ قرار داد. راهنمای Planetizen 2012 برای برنامه‌های تحصیلات تکمیلی برنامه‌ریزی شهری، برنامه MURP ویرجینیا تک را در رتبه ۱۹ قرار داد. برنامه MURP ویرجینیا تک نیز در میان بهترین برنامه‌های فناوری، برنامه‌ریزی کاربری اراضی، برنامه‌ریزی محیطی و مدیریت رشد رتبه‌بندی شد.
پردیس ویرجینیا تک در بلاکسبورگ، ویرجینیا واقع شده‌است. پردیس مرکزی تقریباً با جاده‌های Fork Road از شمال غربی، Plantation Drive از غرب، Main Street از شرق و جاده کمربندی US 460 در جنوب همسایه است، اگرچه چندین هزار هکتار آن فراتر از پردیس مرکزی است.
در مرکز محوطه دانشگاه بلکسبرگ، دریل فیلد واقع شده‌است، یک میدان بیضی شکل بزرگ که از شمال شرقی به جنوب غربی می‌رود، و توسط یک خیابان یک طرفه احاطه شده‌است که به Drillfield Drive معروف است. نام دریلفیلد که در سال ۱۹۲۶ پس از اتمام اولین استادیوم واقعی ویرجینیا تک، استادیوم مایلز ساخته شد، ناشی از استفاده آن توسط کادیتان ویرجینیا تک برای انجام تمرین‌های نظامی است. یک آبراه، Stroubles Creek، در زیر Drillfield در سمت جنوب قرار دارد. یک کانال سه طرفه برای نهر که بستر طبیعی نهر را حفظ می‌کند در سال ۱۹۳۴ نصب شد و در سال ۱۹۷۱، دو پیاده‌روی آسفالت اضافه شد. افسانه شهری مبنی بر اینکه دریل فیلد با سرعت یک اینچ در سال در حال غرق شدن است پخش شد اما در حقیقت هیچ پایه و اساسی ندارد.[۲۰][۲۱] در تابستان ۲۰۱۴، سه مسیر خاکی به عنوان بخشی از طرح جامع دانشگاه برای بهبود محوطه سازی و مسیرها، افزودن مناطق نشستن و تقویت ورودی‌های مسیر در اطراف دریل فیلد آسفالت شد.[۲۲]
در ضلع شمال غربی دریل فیلد اکثر ساختمان‌های دانشگاهی و اداری دانشگاه از جمله سالن‌های بوروس و مک برید قرار دارد. در ضلع جنوب شرقی دریل فیلد اکثر ساختمانهای مسکونی از جمله سالنهای اقامت دانشجویان، سالنهای غذاخوری و سالن بدن سازی War Memorial ایستاده‌است. کتابخانه نیومن در ضلع شرقی دانشگاه واقع شده‌است و به پل Torgersen متصل می‌شود که از جاده اصلی دانشگاه، Alumni Mall عبور می‌کند. در شمال دریل فیلد و شمال غربی Alumni Mall , Quad Upper واقع شده‌است که برای بسیاری از دانشجویان به عنوان پردیس نظامی شناخته می‌شود. کواد علیا پادگان سپاه کادت‌ها است.
در محوطه دانشگاه اصلی بلاکسبورگ، اکثر ساختمان‌ها از هاکی استون به عنوان مصالح ساختمانی استفاده می‌کنند. در دهه ۱۹۹۰، یک کمیته بازدیدکنندگان فناوری ویرجینیا اعلام کردند که از این پس باید از هاکی استون در تمام ساختمان‌های ساخته شده در پردیس مرکزی استفاده شود. در سال ۲۰۱۰، هیئت بازدید کنندگان قطعنامه ای را تصویب کردند که این احساسات سیاست رسمی دانشگاه است.
Hokie Stone به‌طور کلی خاکستری است و سایه‌های آن از رنگ قهوه ای و صورتی است. سنگ آهک از معادن مختلف در جنوب غربی ویرجینیا، تنسی و آلاباما استخراج می‌شود - یکی از آنها از دهه ۱۹۵۰ توسط دانشگاه اداره می‌شود. با این حال، گرچه درست است که اکثر ساختمانهای دانشگاه Hokie Stone را در طراحی خود گنجانده‌اند، اما چند استثنا not قابل توجه وجود دارد. به عنوان مثال، چندین ساختمان قدیمی در Quad Upper، از جمله Lane Hall، از آجر قرمز ساخته شده‌اند مانند Hallcrest Hall و Donaldson Brown. همچنین، تعدادی از ساختمانهای دانشگاهی با استفاده از سنگ هوکی احداث نشده‌اند، زیرا این ساختمانها قبل از اجرای قانون برای استفاده از آن در تمام ساختمانهای جدید دانشگاه ساخته شده‌اند.
در بهار سال ۲۰۰۷، توسط تیراندازی یکی از دانشجویان کره ای سال آخر رشته زبان انگلیسی، ۳۲ دانشجو و استاد به قتل رسیدند.
در ۱۶ آوریل ۲۰۰۷، دانشجو ویرجینیا سونگ-هوی چو ۳۲ عضو هیئت علمی و دانشجویان را به ضرب گلوله کشته و ۱۷ نفر دیگر را در دو مکان در دانشگاه زخمی کرد قبل از این که خود را بکشد در حالی که پلیس درهای نوریس هال را که چو قبل از شروع قتل‌عام خود بسته بود، زیر پا گذاشت. این قتل‌عام، مرگبارترین تیراندازی دسته جمعی در دانشگاه‌ها است، که از عصبانیت چارلز ویتمن در دانشگاه تگزاس در سال ۱۹۶۶ پیشی گرفت. اگرچه در آن زمان مرگبارترین تیراندازی دسته جمعی توسط یک فرد مسلح در تاریخ ایالات متحده بود، اما از آن زمان با دو مورد پیشی گرفته شده‌است. تیراندازی در یک کلوپ شبانه اورلاندو و یک جشنواره موسیقی در فضای باز در لاس وگاس. این دومین قتل‌عام مدرسه ای در تاریخ ایالات متحده است که فقط از بمب‌گذاری در مدرسه حمام در سال ۱۹۲۷ که منجر به کشته شدن ۴۴ نفر شد، فراتر نرفت.
کشتار ویرجینیا تک منجر به بحث و جدال سراسری در مورد حقوق اسلحه، ایمنی اسلحه و کارایی مناطق آزاد اسلحه شد. این تیراندازی دسته جمعی، بسیاری از ایالت‌ها را بر آن داشت تا قوانینی را منع کنند که کالج‌ها و دانشگاه‌های عمومی را از تحریم سلاح‌های مخفی در دانشگاه برای دارندگان مجوز منع کند. در سال ۲۰۱۳، حداقل نوزده ایالت قوانینی را برای اجازه حمل مخفی در دانشگاه به نوعی وضع کردند و در جلسه قانون گذاری سال ۲۰۱۴، حداقل چهارده ایالت قانون مشابهی را وضع کردند. تنسی در سال ۲۰۱۶ لایحه ای را تصویب کرد که به اعضای هیئت علمی اجازه می‌داد پس از اطلاع به نیروی انتظامی محلی، اسلحه‌های دستی در دانشگاه حمل کنند. در سال ۲۰۱۵، تگزاس هشتمین ایالت مجاز سلاح‌های مخفی در دانشگاه‌ها شد. در دسامبر ۲۰۱۶، فرماندار جان کاسیچ لایحه قانونی را امضا کرد که ممنوعیت اسلحه گرم در دانشگاه‌های اوهایو را در دانشگاه لغو کرد و این تصمیم را به عهده مؤسسات منفرد گذاشت. در سال ۲۰۱۷ جورجیا دهمین ایالت شد که کالج‌ها و دانشگاه‌ها را از تحریم سلاح‌های مخفی در دانشگاه منع می‌کند. اگرچه قانون ویرجینیا به مؤسسات فردی اجازه می‌دهد تا در مورد اجازه سلاح‌های مخفی در دانشگاه تصمیم بگیرند، ویرجینیا تک همچنان دارندگان مجوز حمل پنهان را از حمل اسلحه در دانشگاه منع می‌کند.

Son campus est situé à l'extrême Sud-Ouest de l'État de Virginie entre les monts Blue Ridge de la chaîne des Appalaches. Bien que généraliste et possédant de nombreuses facultés, cette université est particulièrement réputée pour ses départements d'agriculture, d'ingénierie, d'architecture, d'administration publique, de sylviculture, et de médecine vétérinaire. C'est aussi l'une des seules universités du pays possédant un « corps de cadets » (une école militaire).
Virginia Tech est particulièrement connue pour ses programmes d'enseignement et de recherche et son équipe de football américain les Hokies de Virginia Tech.
En 2004 et 2005, The Times a classé Virginia Tech parmi les 200 meilleures universités du monde.
Il a accueilli les dindes graciées (en) par le président Donald Trump à l'occasion du Thanksgiving en 2016, 2017 et 2018[1],[2].
En 2003, Virginia Tech a créé un superordinateur qui fut classé le troisième ordinateur le plus rapide du monde. Le système, composé de mille cent processeurs, coûta 5,2 millions de dollars. Il a été démonté peu après avoir réalisé cette performance et remplacé par des serveurs Apple qui consomment moins d'énergie et moins d'espace.
La recherche sur le réseau Internet fait partie intégrante de l'histoire de Virginia Tech. Cette université a participé au développement des réseaux Suranet, Internet2, Abilene Network, le Lambda rail network et d'autres réseaux similaires. Virginia Tech a aussi participé au Net.Work.Virginia et au Mid Atlantic Crossroads.
L'université est aussi tristement célèbre pour avoir été le siège de l'une des plus grandes tueries scolaires de l'histoire américaine, avec 33 morts, le 16 avril 2007.
Virginia Tech était une « zone sans armes » et interdisait même aux étudiants avec un port d'armes d'apporter les leurs sur le campus. En 2006, l'université expédia devant le conseil de discipline un étudiant qui en transportait une sur le campus, bien qu'il ait eu un permis en bonne et due forme.
Le 4 août 2011, une personne armée est signalée sur le campus de Virginia Tech, sans qu'aucune personne ne soit blessée ou tuée[3].
Le 8 décembre 2011, une fusillade fait deux morts dont 1 policier[4].

Institut Politeknik dan Universitas Negeri Virginia (dalam bahasa Inggris: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, atau yang biasa lebih dikenal sebagai Virginia Tech (juga disingkat VPI), adalah sebuah universitas politeknik di Blacksburg, Virginia, Amerika Serikat. Meskipun sekolah ini komprehensif memiliki banyak fakultas, program-program pertanian, teknik, arsitektur, kehutanan, dan kedokteran hewannya dianggap sebagai yang paling kuat. Perguruan tinggi ini juga merupakan salah satu dari segelintir universitas di seluruh Amerika Serikat dengan korps kadet (komponen pendidikan militer penuh waktu) dalam sebuah universitas sipil yang lebih luas (lainnya antara lain adalah Universitas Texas A&M dan Universitas Norwich).
Selain program-program riset dan akademiknya, Virginia Tech terkenal karena kampusnya dan lokasinya di Lembah New River di Virginia barat daya di Pegunungan Blue Ridge, bagian dari Pegunungan Appalachia. Nama universitas ini di masyarakat belakangan ini telah mencuat dalam tahun-tahun belakangan dengan keberhasilan program footballnya dan penembakan di Virginia Tech, penembakan liar paling berdarah dalam sejarah Amerika.
Pada 1872, Majelis Umum Virginia membeli tanah dan gedung milik sebuah sekolah Methodis kecil yang bernama Institut Olin dan Preston di pedesaan di Kabupaten Montgomery dengan dana federal yang disediakan oleh Akta Morrill. Pemerintah negara bagian mendirikan sebuah lembaga yang baru di tempat itu, sebuah akademi militer yang tanahnya diberikan oleh pemerintah, yang dinamai Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College.
Ketika John M. McBryde menjadi presidennya (1891-1907), sekolah ini menata kembali program-program akademiknya menjadi sebuah perguruan tinggi empat tahun yang tradisional. Pada 1896 namanya pun diubah menjadi Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute. Bagian "Agricultural and Mechanical College" dari nama ini kemudian dihapuskan, meskipun namanya baru resmi diganti menjadi Virginia Polytechnic Institute pada 1944 sebagai bagian dari penggabungannya dengan apa yang kini dikenal sebagai Universitas Radford—yang hanya berlangsung sebentar. VPI memperoleh akreditasi penuh pada 1923, dan persyaratan untuk ikut serta dalam Korps Kadet dikurangi dari empat tahun menjadi dua tahun pada tahun itu juga (untuk laki-laki saja; untuk perempuan, ketika mereka mulai mendaftar pada 1920-an, tak pernah diwajibkan bergabung).
Presiden Universitas ini, T. Marshall Hahn, yang masa jabatannya berlangsung dari 1962 hingga 1974, bertanggung jawab atas perubahan-perubahan yang menjadikan Virginia Tech sebuah institusi modern. Penggabungan dengan Radford dihentikan pada 1964, dan pada 1966, sekolah ini menghapuskan kewajiban latihan militer dua tahun bagi mahasiswanya. Pada 1973, mahasiswi diizinkan bergabung dengan Korpsnya. Virginia Tech adalah sekolah pertama di AS yang membuka sayap militernya bagi perempuan. Salah astu misi Hahn yang paling kontroversial hanya tercapai sebagian. Ia mempunyai keinginan untuk mengubah nama VPI menjadi Universitas Negeri Virginia, untuk mencerminkan status yang telah dicapainya sebagai sebuah lembaga pendidikan umum penuh dan universitas riset. Sebagain bagian dari langkah ini, Virginia Tech akan mengambil alih institusi lainnya yang juga mendapatkan tanahnya dari negara bagian, sebuah perguruan tinggi historis kulit hitam di Ettrick, Virginia, selatan Richmond, yang saat itu dinamai Virginia State College. Rencana ini gagal, dan sekolah itu akhirnya menjadi Universitas Negeri Virginia. Sebagai kompromi, VPI menambahkan pada namanya "dan Universitas Negeri" pada 1970, sehingga nama resminya sekarang menjadi Institut Politeknik dan Universitas Negeri Virginia. Pada awal 1990-an, sekolah ini diam-diam mengesahkan nama Virginia Tech untuk digunakan secara resmi sebagai nama ekuivalen dengan nama lengkapnya VPI&SU. Banyak dokumen sekolah yang kini menggunakan nama yang lebih singkat ini, meskipun ijazah dan transkripnya masih menggunakan nama resminya secara lengkap. Demikian pula, singkatan VT lebih umum sekarang daripada VPI atau VPI&SU, dan muncul di mana-mana, dari seragam atletik, hingga nama domain internet universitasnya, vt.edu.
Pada 16 April 2007, di kampus sekolah ini terjadi penembakan liar.[1] Menurut laporan media, setidak-tidaknya 32[2] orang tewas, termasuk si penembak sendiri, dan sekurang-kurangnya 25[1] lainnya luka-luka. Penembakan terjadi di sebuah gedung akademik serta sebuah asrama. Setelah penembakan ini, semua kelas dibatalkan, dan kampusnya dikunci oleh pemerintah setempat dan pimpinan kampus. Laporan-laporan awal tentang kejadian ini membingungkan dan kontradiktif, termasuk jumlah korban dan luka-luka yang disebutkan oleh berbagai kantor berita. Laporan-laporan dari saksi mata dan mereka yang selamat menyebutkan bahwa penembaknya adalah seorang laki-laki Korea berusia 23 tahun bernama Cho Seung-Hui.
Untuk kelas mahasiswa baru pada musim gugur 2006, Virginia Tech ada 19.046 calon mahasiswa yang mendaftar dan menerima 67% di antaranya [1] Diarsipkan 2007-03-10 di Wayback Machine. (sekitar 12.700). Sejumlah 39% dari mereka yang diterima (sekitar 5000 mahasiswa) memilih untuk mendaftar kembali. Sekitar 21% dari angkatan baru ini diisi oleh calon-calon yang mengambil keputusan dini untuk masuk ke situ. Angka rata-rata mahasiswanya ditingkatkan, tetapi angka SAT menurun sedikit. Ciri khas mahasiswa baru yang masuk di musim gugur 2006 mempunyai angka rata-rata di SMA 3,74, dengan rentangan tengahnya antara 3,38 hingga 3,95. Angka SAT kumulatif rata-ratanya 1201, menurun dua angka dari rata-rata tahun sebelumnya, yakni 1203.[3]
Virginia Tech menawarkan 60 program sarjana dan 140 program Master dan Doktor melalui Sekolah Tinggi Pertanian dan Sains Kehidupan, Sekolah Tinggi Arsitektur & Studi Perkotaan, Sekolah Tinggi Liberal Art dan Ilmu-ilmu Kemnusiaan, Sekolah Tinggi Bisnis Pamplin, Sekolah Tinggi Teknik, Sekolah Tinggi Sumber Daya Alam, Sekolah Tinggi Sains, dan Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine. Sekolah Tinggi Pertanian dan Sains Kehidupan menaawrkan program gelar associate yang berlangsung dua tahun di kampus, dalam teknologi pertanian.

La Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University meglio nota come Virginia Tech, è un'importante università di Blacksburg, Virginia, negli Stati Uniti d'America.
Fondata nel 1872 durante la presidenza di Ulysses S. Grant come centro di insegnamento di materie agrarie e meccaniche, i suoi corsi principali riguardano ingegneria, architettura, scienza, economia e agraria. Fa parte del land grant, un raggruppamento di atenei che ricevono fondi per la ricerca sulle scienze agricole e del suolo.
Il 16 aprile 2007 il campus dell'ateneo è stato teatro del cosiddetto "Massacro del Virginia Tech". Tale episodio - il secondo per gravità in fatto di massacri scolastici nella storia degli USA dopo il massacro della Bath School - è costato la vita a trentadue persone (escluso l'omicida), mentre altre ventinove hanno riportato ferite di diversa entità[senza fonte].
Altri progettiהמכון הפוליטכני של וירג'ינה ואוניברסיטת המדינה (באנגלית: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University; בראשי תיבות: VT; בכינוי: VA Tech או VPI; בעברית: וירג'יניה טק) הוא מוסד אקדמי ציבורי ללימודים פוליטכניים בעיר בלקסבורג (אנ') שבווירג'יניה, ארצות הברית. אף שווירג'יניה טק היא אוניברסיטה רב-תחומית, תוכניות הלימוד בחקלאות, בהנדסה, באדריכלות, ביערנות וברפואה וטרינרית, הן התוכניות הבולטות ונחשבות לטובות במוסד. וירג'יניה טק היא אחת ממספר קטן של אוניברסיטאות ציבוריות בארצות הברית שבהן מסלול הכשרה לקצונה צבאית.
פרסומה של וירג'יניה טק בא לה, לא רק בזכות תוכניות הלימוד הקיימות בה, אלא גם בזכות מיקומה בעמק ניו ריבר, בפינה הדרום מערבית של וירג'יניה, בהרי הבלו רידג' שהם חלק מהרי האפלצ'ים. בשנים האחרונות זכתה האוניברסיטה להכרה בארצות הברית בזכות נבחרת הפוטבול המוצלחת שלה.
בשנת 1872 רכשה האספה הכללית של מדינת וירג'יניה את המבנים של בית ספר מתודיסטי קטן במחוז מונטגומרי, ובמימון של המדינה הוקמה במקום "מכללת וירג'יניה לחקלאות ולימודים מכניים". בשנים 1891–1907 עברה המכללה ארגון מחדש והפכה למכללה מסורתית עם מסלול לימודים בן 4 שנים (אף שנותרו בה המחלקות למכניקה ולהנדסה). בעקבות השינוי שונה שמה של המכללה ונקרא "המכללה לחקלאות וללימודים מכניים והמוסד הפוליטכני של וירג'יניה" ובשנת 1944 שונה שמו של המוסד פעם נוספת והוא נקרא: "המוסד הפוליטכני של וירג'יניה", שם שהיה שגור בפי רבים זמן רב קודם לכן. בשנת 1923 קיבלה המכללה הכרה מלאה כמוסד אקדמי ובאותה עת הופחתה הדרישה על התלמידים להשתתפות בקורסי הכנה טרום-צבאיים לשנתיים בלבד (במקום ארבע לפני כן). בשנת 1966 הופסקה הדרישה להשתתפות במסלול ההכשרה הצבאי והפך למסלול בחירה. בשנת 1970 שונה שמה של המכללה פעם נוספת ונוספו לו המילים "ואוניברסיטת המדינה" כדי לציין את היותו מוסד ציבורי מרכזי ללימודים אקדמיים רב תחומיים (ולא רק פוליטכניים) במדינת וירג'יניה. בשנת 1973 הותרה לראשונה השתתפות נשים במסלול ההכשרה הצבאי.  בתחילת שנות ה-90, מבלי שנעשתה הכרזה רשמית על כך, החלה האוניברסיטה להתיר את הצגתה בשם המקוצר "וירג'יניה טק". נכון לתחילת המאה ה-21 מופיע השם המקוצר על רבים מן המסמכים הרשמיים של המוסד, אף שעל התעודות המוענקות לבוגרים מופיע עדיין השם המלא. המוסד אף ידוע בראשי התיבות VT, המופיע אף בשם אתר האינטרנט של המוסד: vt.edu. כיום המוסד נחשב לאחד משלוש אוניברסיטאות הדגל במערכת המוסדות הציבוריים להשכלה גבוהה של מדינת וירג'יניה (ביחד עם האוניברסיטה של וירג'יניה והקולג' של ויליאם ומרי (אנ')).
ב-16 באפריל 2007 התרחש בתחומי קמפוס האוניברסיטה אירוע ירי שבמהלכו נרצחו 27 סטודנטים וחמישה אנשי צוות. כמו כן נפצעו בני אדם נוספים. היה זה אירוע ירי לשם רצח המוני החמור ביותר, בידי מתנקש בודד, בתולדות ארצות הברית.
בסתיו 2006 קיבל המוסד 19,046 בקשות להתקבל ללימודי תואר ראשון ומתוכן התקבלו ללימודים 67% (כ-12,700)[1].39% מכלל המתקבלים (כ-5,000 סטודנטים) בחרו ללמוד במוסד. 
בווירג'יניה טק כ-60 תוכניות לימוד שונות לקבלת תואר ראשון וכ-140 תוכניות לימוד לקבלת תואר שני ושלישי. תוכניות הלימוד נלמדות בבית הספר לחקלאות ולמדעי החיים, בית הספר לאדריכלות וללימודים אורבניים, בית הספר לאמנות ולמדעי הרוח, בית הספר לעסקים, בית הספר להנדסה, בית הספר למשאבי טבע, בית הספר למדע, ובית הספר לרפואה וטרינרית. בבית הספר לחקלאות ומדעי החיים מתקיימת התוכנית היחידה במוסד שאורכה שנתיים בלבד, להכשרת טכנאי חקלאות.
וירג'יניה טק מדורגת במקום ה-34 מבין האוניברסיטאות הציבוריות בארצות הברית, ובמקום ה-77 מבין כל האוניברסיטאות בארצות הברית. התוכנית ללימודי תואר ראשון בבית הספר להנדסה דורגה במקום ה-9 בארצות הברית מבין המוסדות הציבורים ובמקום ה-17 מבין כל מוסדות הלימוד המוכרים להנדסה המציעים מסלול לתואר דוקטור.

バージニア工科大学（バージニアこうかだいがく、英語: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University）は、米国バージニア州ブラックスバーグに本部を置くアメリカ合衆国の州立大学。1872年創立、1872年大学設置。大学の略称はバージニア・テック (Virginia Tech)、VT、VPI。
バージニア・テック (Virginia Tech) の略称でも知られる。
バージニア州で2番目に大きい公立大学であり[1]、280の学部課程と修士・博士課程を擁し、その生徒数は34,400人にも上る。また、学部・院を合わせてバージニア州で最多、全米46位にあたる5億2200万ドルにも上る研究費を計上している[2]。
現在では総合大学になっているが、モリル・ランドグラント法に基づき理系のランドグラント大学として創立された歴史のため工学、建築、獣医学等の分野における業績で特に評価が高く、東海岸にある理系の名門校の一つである。
陸海空軍の予備役将校訓練課程（ROTC）が設置されており、軍との関係も密接で全米で6校しかない上級軍事大学 (Senior Military College) の指定を受けている。その関係上、卒業生の就職先で最も割合が高いのが米軍であり、その他軍需産業との研究・人材の繋がりも密接である。
1872年、バージニア州は、モリル・ランドグラント法の基金で購入されたモントゴメリー郡の小さなメソジストの学校施設に、バージニア農業機械大学 (Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College) を軍学校として設立した[3]。
1891年から1907年に学長を務めたジョン・M・マックブライド (John M. McBryde) の時代に、大学は4年制となり、1896年には校名をバージニア農業機械・工科大学 (Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute) に改めた。大学は、この改名後すぐに、一般にはバージニア工科大学 (Virginia Polytechnic Institute) と呼ばれるようになったが、正式にこの名称となったのは、1944年のことであった[4]。
1923年には、士官候補生団 (Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets) への参加義務が4年から2年に短縮された。1943年には、ラドフォードに位置するラドフォード州立師範大学 (Radford State Teachers College) を統合し、女子部とした[5]。
1962年から1974年に学長を務めたT・マーシャル・ハーン (T. Marshall Hahn) は、様々な改革を行った。バージニア州では男女分離が解消されメインキャンパスへの女子学生の入学が認められるようになっていたため、1964年には女子部（旧ラドフォード州立師範大学）を分離し、これによってラドフォード大学が成立した。1966年には士官候補生団への参加義務を撤廃した。1973年には、全米で初めて女子学生の士官候補生団への参加が認められた[6]。
1965年にバージニア高等教育委員会は校名に"University"を付加することを勧告したが、具体的な校名について意見がまとまらず校名変更は難航した。教員評議会からはバージニア州立大学 (State University of Virginia) という名称も提案されたが、大学評議会は最も広く受け入れられたのはバージニア工科・州立大学 (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) を学長であったハーンに勧告し、大学は1970年にこの校名に改称した[7][6]。1990年代にはいるとバージニア・テック (Virginia Tech) という名称の使用が公式に認められ、大学の書類の多くで用いられるようになった（ただし、卒業証書などでは正式名称が使用される）。同様に、略称としても、VPI や VPI&SU よりも VT の方がはるかに一般的になり、スポーツのユニフォームや大学のドメインネームにも使われるようになった。
バージニア工科大学は以下の7つの学部を有する。
また、上記の学部以外に以下の研究・教育機関を有する。
バージニア工科大学のキャンパスは、バージニア州ブラックスバーグにある。キャンパスの中心部は、北西でプライセズ・フォーク・ロード（Prices Fork Road）、西でプランテーション・ドライブ（Plantation Drive）、東でメイン・ストリート（Main Street）、南で国道460号バイパスで区切られているが、キャンパスはその外部にも数千エーカーにわたって広がっている。また、ブラックスバーグのほかに、ハンプトン・ローズ（バージニア・ビーチ）、首都地区（バージニア州フォールズチャーチ - アレクサンドリア）、リッチモンド、ロアノーク、南西バージニア高等教育センター（アビンドン）に支部キャンパスがある。
ブラックスバーグ・キャンパスは、ドリル・フィールドと呼ばれる長円形の広場を、多くの建物が取り囲んで形成されている。
ブラックスバーグ・キャンパスでは、多くの建物にホーキー・ストーンという石材が建築材料として使われている。ホーキー・ストーンは灰色、茶色、黒、ピンク、オレンジ、赤茶色といった様々な色の混じった石灰岩で、苦灰石を含むことがある。バージニア南西部、テネシー州、アラバマ州の採石場で採掘されるが、そのうちのひとつは1950年代以降、大学によって操業されている。
バージニア工科大学は、2007年の『プリンストン・レビュー』で「ベスト・キャンパス・フード」の第1位に輝いた。大学内には7か所に食堂施設群があり、Au Bon Pain、Sbarro、Chick-fil-A、ピザハット、シナボン等が入っている。
バージニア工科大学が2003年11月に1,100台のデュアルプロセッサ搭載Power Mac G5を導入し、2,200基のPowerPC G5プロセッサをクラスター化して構築したSystem X（愛称"Big Mac"）は、当時世界で3番目に速いスーパーコンピュータであった。かかったコストの低さは特筆に値し、従来の最速といわれるスパコン構築には1億〜2.5億ドルのコストがかかるといわれているが、同大が構築したシステムは520万ドルのコストだったという。試験運用時にBig Macシステムは8.1TFlops（理論値は16.8TFlops）を記録し、後に10.28TFlopsを記録した。
2004年にシステムを再構築し、最大12.25TFlopsを計測した。この際、米Appleはオーダーメイドの2.3GHz Xserve G5 Clusterモデルを特別に提供しており（当時、市販されていたのは2.0GHzまで）、1150台への増強も伴い少なからず速度向上に貢献している。なお、バージニア工科大学はこのシステム再構築に60万ドルかかったとしている。
2008年11月には、325台のMac Pro(2つの4-core 2.8GHz Xeon搭載モデル, 合計2600基のCPUコア)と世界初のQDR InfiniBandを利用した低コスト・省電力なSystem Gを構築し、22.8TFlopsを記録、省電力におけるHPCの研究に利用している。
バージニア工科大学は、1984年に公立機関として初めて工学部の学生にパソコンの所有を義務づけた学校であり、2006年からは工学部の新入生にタブレットPCの所有を義務づけている。
バージニア工科大学（バージニアテック）は、NCAAのディビジョンIで、以下の18（ディビジョンI-Aのアメリカン・フットボールを含む）の競技に参加している。
バージニア工科大学が参加する18の競技のうち、水の分子式のH2OとホーキーズをかけてH2Okiesと名乗っている水泳を除く全てのチームで、バージニアテック・ホーキーズ（Virginia Tech Hokies）というチーム名が使用されている。ホーキーズというチーム名は、1896年に作られた「オールド・ホーキー」（Old Hokie）という応援の掛け声に由来する。
ホーキーズというチーム名が使われるようになる前には、ファイティング・ゴブラーズ（Fighting Gobblers）というチーム名が使われていた。これは、バージニア工科大学はかつては軍人の育成を目的とする大学であり、その士官候補生団には食糧不足の時代にも充分な食事が与えられたことから、むさぼり食う人々（gobblers）という名が付けられたものだと言われる。
ホーキーズのチームカラーはシカゴ・マルーン ■ とバーント・オレンジ ■ で、1896年に、当時他のどのチームも使っていない組合せであるという理由で選ばれた。
チームのマスコットは、ホーキーバード（Hokie Bird）という、七面鳥に似た生き物である。これは、かつてのチーム名であるファイティング・ゴブラーズ（Fighting Gobblers）の「ゴブラー」（Gobbler）に雄の七面鳥という意味があることに由来する。ホーキーバードという名前は、チーム名がホーキーズに変わった後の1980年代半ばから使われるようになったものである。
ホーキーズは、2003年からアトランティック・コースト・カンファレンス（ACC）に属している。2003年にACCに移るまでは、様々なカンファレンスを転々としており、例えば、1995年から2000年まではアトランティック10カンファレンス（フットボール及びレスリングを除く。フットボールは1991年以降ビッグ・イースト・カンファレンスに所属。）、2000年から2003年まではビッグ・イースト・カンファレンス（レスリングを除く。）に所属していた。
バージニア工科大学のアメリカンフットボールのチームは、カレッジフットボールの強豪として知られ、1993年以来連続してボウル・ゲームに進出している。
特に1999年シーズンには11勝0敗でシーズンを終え、全米チャンピオンをかけてシュガーボウルに出場したが敗れ、ランキング2位に終わっている。
2004年に移籍したACCはフットボールの強豪チームが多く属するカンファレンスであり、ホーキーズの移籍は、地元のロアノーク・タイムズ紙の記者に「私が生きているうちに、バージニアテックがACCで優勝することはないだろう。」と評された。しかし、バージニアテックのフットボール・チームは、移籍したその年に優勝を果たし、記者のもとには「葬式はいつか」と問い合わせる電話が殺到した。ホーキーズは、その後、2007年、2008年にもカンファレンスのチャンピオンとなっている。
同じバージニア州の州立大学であるバージニア大学とは長きにわたるライバル関係にあり、両校の間では毎年コモンウェルス・カップ（Commonwealth Cup）が争われる。また隣接するウェストバージニア州のウェストバージニア大学との間では、1997年から2005年の間、ブラック・ダイアモンド・トロフィー（Black Diamond Trophy）が争われたが、ホーキーズがACCに移籍して両校が異なるカンファレンスに属することになったこともあり、2006年以降は開催されていない。ACCでは、パーマネント・ライバルという制度があり、バージニア工科大学のパーマネント・ライバルはボストン・カレッジとされている。
ホーキーズのホーム・スタジアムは、66,233人を収容するレーン・スタジアム（Lane Stadium）である。
バージニア工科大学では、海外からの留学生の受け入れ及び海外への留学生の派遣を積極的に行っている。日本の大学については、北見工業大学、横浜国立大学、九州大学、関西外国語大学との間で学術交流協定を結んでおり、学生の交換などを行っている。
U.S. News & World Report's の"2021 Best Colleges"では、バージニア工科大は全米で74位（タイ）、全米の公立大学では29位（タイ）にランキングされている[8]。工学部の評価は特に高く、私立大学を含む全米ランキングで13位（テキサスA&M大学等とタイ）にランクされている[9]。
2007年4月16日朝、同大学の学生寮及び講義棟でグリーンカード（永住権）を持つ同大学4年生の韓国人学生、チョ・スンヒ（23歳）が銃を乱射、32名（教員5名、学生27名）を殺害し自殺した。この乱射事件は、発生当時、アメリカ史上最多の最悪の事件であった。

Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (or Virginia Tech) is a public land-grant university in Blacksburg, Virginia. The campus was first opened in 1872 as a farming and mechanical college and covers 2,600 acres. It is also one of only a few public universities in the United States to have a corps of cadets.
The Virginia Tech massacre, which happened on the 16th of April 2007, was a tragedy in the history of the University. A student of the university named Cho Seung-Hui killed 32 people before killing himself. This became the worst school-related massacre in United States history.


Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (tunnetaan paremmin nimellä Virginia Tech, suom. Virginian teknillinen yliopisto) on Yhdysvaltain itärannikolla sijaitsevan Virginian osavaltion suurin yliopisto. Virginia Tech on Texas A&M Universityn ohella maan ainoa julkinen yliopisto, jossa annetaan myös laajamittaista sotilaskoulutusta (Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets). 
Virginia Tech on tunnettu laajoista urheiluperinteistään, etenkin amerikkalaisesta jalkapallosta, sekä yliopiston kampuksella 16. huhtikuuta 2007 tapahtuneesta verilöylystä.

Virginia Tech on arvioitu Yhdysvaltain 34. parhaaksi julkiseksi yliopistoksilähde? ja 77. parhaaksi kansalliseksi yliopistoksilähde?. Virginia Techin insinöörikoulu on arvioitu julkisten yliopistojen yhdeksänneksilähde? ja kansallisten yliopistojen 17. parhaaksi insinöörikouluksilähde?. Yliopiston arkkitehtuurin tiedekunta on arvioitu yhdeksi maan parhaistalähde?. Vuonna 2006 Virginia Techin hakijamäärä oli 19 046, joista 67 prosenttia hyväksyttiin. Hyväksytyistä 39 prosenttia otti paikan vastaan. 
Virginia Tech ilmoitti 3. tammikuuta 2007 perustavansa lääketieteellisen tiedekunnan. Tiedekunnan on tarkoitus aloittaa toimintansa vuonna 2009 tai 2010. Tiedekunnan kooksi tulee noin 40 oppilasta per vuosikurssi, joten kyseessä on pieni lääketieteellinen tiedekunta.
Virginia Tech tarjoaa 60 kandidaatin tutkinto-ohjelmaa ja 140 maisterin ja tohtorin tutkinto-ohjelmaa kaikissa muissa tiedekunnissa paitsi maatalouden tiedekunnassa. 
Kymmenen suosituinta pääainetta vuoden 2005 aloittaneilla olivat yleiset yliopisto-opinnot, yleinen insinööritiede, kauppatiede, biologia, viestintä, psykologia, markkinointi, valtiotiede, arkkitehtuuri ja eläinlääketiede.
Vuonna 1872 Virginian kansainkokous osti liittovaltion myöntämillä rahoilla (Morrill Act) pienehkön, Montgomery Countyssa sijaitsevan metodistikoulun tilat (The Olin and Preston Institute). Paikalle perustettiin osavaltion rahoittama laitos, The Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College.
Aivan 1800-luvun lopussa koulutusohjelmat järjestettiin nelivuotiseksi collegeksi. Tämän myötä nimi vaihtui vuonna 1896 Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Instituteksi. Yleisön keskuudessa nimi Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) vakiintui heti käyttöön, joskin siitä tuli virallinen vasta vuonna 1944 kun laitos yhdistyi lyhytaikaisesti nykyisen Radford Universityn kanssa (liitos purettiin vuonna 1964). 
Naisia VPI alkoi vastaanottaa 1920-luvulla. Vuonna 1966 miesten kahden vuoden pakollisesta sotilaskoulutusvaatimuksesta luovuttiin. Vuonna 1973 naisten sallittiin ensimmäisenä yliopistona maassa osallistua myös sotilaskoulutukseen.
Nimi vaihtui vuonna 1970 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Universityksi ja 1990-luvun alussa lyhenne Virginia Tech (VT) virallistettiin.
16. huhtikuuta 2007 Virginia Techissa tapahtui Yhdysvaltain kouluhistorian suurin ja pahin verilöyly. Etelä-Koreasta kotoisin ollut 23-vuotias opiskelija Cho Seung-hui ampui yliopistolla 32 ihmistä ja surmasi lopulta itsensä. Lisäksi 29 ihmistä loukkaantui.[1]
8. joulukuuta 2011 tuntematon ampuja ampui poliisin ja yhden koulun oppilaan.[2]
Virginia Tech on laaja-alainen yliopisto. Sen tunnetuimpia ja vahvimpia laitoksia ovat maatalous, tekniset tieteet, arkkitehtuuri, eläinlääketiede ja metsätalous.

弗吉尼亚理工学院暨州立大学（英語：Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University），简称弗吉尼亚理工大学（英語：Virginia Tech），创建于1872年，是一所著名公立研究型大学，主校区位于弗吉尼亚州的黑堡，另于该州其他地区、瑞士、多米尼加等地设有研究中心。弗吉尼亚理工大学亦是六所提供预备役军官训练团项目的美国高等军事院校之一[4]。截至2022年秋季，弗吉尼亚理工大学提供280个本科和研究生项目，注册学生达37000人，在全世界的校友达24万人。在2024 U.S. News & World Report全美最佳大学排名中，弗吉尼亚理工大学位于全美第47名，公立大学第20名。[5]。
1872年，依照《土地拨赠法案》，弗吉尼亚州议会动用联邦资金购置了濒临破产的普雷斯顿-欧林学院（英语：Preston and Olin Institute）的设施。该校原址位于蒙哥马利县郊区，为一所卫理公会学校。弗吉尼亚联邦随后将该地改制为政府赠地，并在此建立了一所叫做“弗吉尼亚农工学院（Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College）”的军事院校[7]。
在第七任校长约翰·麦克拉伦·麦克布莱德掌管学院期间（任期：1891年-1907年），弗吉尼亚农工学院将其学制修改为传统院校的四年制，而这个改变也促使学校更名为“弗吉尼亚农工学院暨理工学院（Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute）”。由于当时人们已经省略校名中的“农工学院（Agricultural and Mechanical College）”部分；1944年，学校的名称正式缩减为“弗吉尼亚理工学院（Virginia Polytechnic Institute, VPI）”[8]。1923年，弗吉尼亚理工学院将四年学制压缩至两年，并于1931年起在威廉与玛丽学院的诺福克分校授课（即现在的奥多明尼昂大学）。[9]随后，在威廉与玛丽学院的诺福克分校完成两年课业的学生可以转学至弗吉尼亚理工学院，继续完成剩下两年的课程。1943年，弗吉尼亚理工学院吸收雷德福州立师范学院（英语：Radford State Teachers College），后者成为它的女子部；1964年合并解散。雷德福大学现在成为一所超过9900名学生、提供150个本科和研究生项目的独立大学[10]。
如今的弗吉尼亚理工大学的许多成就，都要归功于第十三任校长托马斯·马歇尔·哈恩（英语：T. Marshall Hahn）（任期：1962年-1974年）的努力[11]。他的愿景是将的弗吉尼亚理工学院逐渐转变成一所综合性研究大学。为达到这一目标，当时弗吉尼亚理工学院每年都会扩招一千名学生，并新建大量寝室楼，聘请更多的教授（例如仅1966年一年就新增了超过100名教授），科研经费也因此迅速增加[12] During the Hahn Presidency the University saw its first Rhodes Scholar in W.W. Lewis, class of 1963.[13]。这一期间，哈恩亦终止与雷德福大学的合作办学计划，去除了两年制强制士官团学习的限制，并在1973年允许女性加入士官团，而弗吉尼亚理工也因此成为美国史上第一所允许女性加入士官团的学校[14]。
哈恩的另一个颇具争议的计划却并未实现。他希望将弗吉尼亚理工学院更名为“弗吉尼亚州立大学（Virginia State University）”，并因此接管时称为“弗吉尼亚州立学院”（Virginia State College，现“弗吉尼亚州立大学”Virginia State University）的传统黑人大学。这个计划未能实现，作为妥协，学校更名为现时的正式名称“弗吉尼亚理工学院暨州立大学（Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, VPISU）”。由于学校的体育活动兴旺，促使学校在20世纪90年代初，接受“弗吉尼亚理工（Virginia Tech, VT）”这一缩写，并使用在各个公开领域，尽管如此，学校在毕业证书和成绩单中依旧采用全名。
2007年4月16日，弗吉尼亚理工发生伤亡人数惨重的校园枪击案，枪手赵承熙在射杀32人后饮弹自尽[15]。
弗吉尼亚理工大学为超过37000位学生提供280个本科和研究生学位项目，并拥有科研资金多达5.56亿美元[16]。弗吉尼亚理工在黑堡拥有七个学院，另设有弗吉尼亚-马里兰兽医医药区域学院（英语：Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine）。除此之外，由学校和加利永诊所合办的一所私立学校，弗吉尼亚理工-加利永医药研究学院（英语：Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute）（Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute）创立于2007年。
弗吉尼亚理工大学的本科学院如下：
在2015年秋，弗吉尼亚理工大学共收到近22,500份申请，比去年同期的20,897份增加了7.6%。通常录取的高中毕业生GPA为4.00，GPA区间中的50%分值为3.81和4.24之间。在SAT的前两项（批判性阅读和数学部分1600满分）中，录取的平均值为1250，中间区间为1160至1340。在录取的5,518名学生中，有20%采取提前决定策略（Early Decision Plan）[17]。
在2009年至2010学年，弗吉尼亚理工研究生学院共录取6,947名希望获得硕士和博士学位的学生。[18]
弗吉尼亚理工另设有荣誉学生课程。荣誉学生有11种不同的方式来得到荣誉学生学分，进而得到五选一的荣誉学生学位。一部分的荣誉学生亦被邀请入住两个荣誉学生公寓——位于安勃勒-强斯顿西宿舍楼（West Ambler Johnston Hall）的荣誉学生公寓社团和希尔克里斯荣誉学生社区（Hillcrest Honors Community）。要想成为荣誉学生，申请人需拥有3.6的GPA，并在申请成功后继续保持3.5的GPA[19]。
在2013年至2014学年，弗吉尼亚理工大学研究生院录取了6,723名研究生（4465名全职、2258名兼职）进入到各自的研究生和硕士项目中[20]。在弗吉尼亚理工-加利永医药研究学院从2,873份申请中仅仅录取了42名学生（2017届），被录取的学生中的MCAT分数为29至40分（中值33分、平均分33分），平均的本科GPA为3.5分[21]。
据《美国新闻和世界报道》的“2023全美最佳大学”排名，弗吉尼亚理工在全美大学中排名第62，全美公立大学中排名第26[5]。

弗吉尼亚理工大学校园（英语：Virginia Tech campus）位于弗吉尼亚州黑堡，居普赖西斯·福克路（Prices Fork Road）以南、种植园路（Plantation Drive）以东、主干道（Main Street）以西、以及美国460国道辅路（US 460 Bypass）以北，主校区大概有数千英亩。
在黑堡校区的中心是以德里尔路包围、椭圆形的德里尔操场（Drillsfield）。德里尔操场命名来自1926年学校建成首个真正的体育场后，弗吉尼亚理工大学士官团（英语：Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets）进行军事操练活动。斯垂博斯溪（Stroubles Creek）流进德里尔操场南侧。一个三边形的溪水导管保留了1934年安装时的溪水原始水床；在1971年建立了两个沥青路。有所谓传闻称德里尔操场每年都有一英尺的下沉，但是并没有证据证明事实[57][58]。2014年暑假，作为大学建造工程之一，三条污水道路被铺平，以提高道路和园林外观，并扩通了进入德里尔操场的道路[59]。
在德里尔操场的西北一侧，伫立着学校的主要学术和行政楼，包括布鲁斯大楼和麦克布雷德楼。在德里尔操场的东南侧，集中着主要的宿舍楼、餐饮楼。纽曼图书馆位于校园中心的东侧，并链接托格森跨桥至校友楼。德里尔操场的北部、校友楼的西北部链接到上四方楼区（Upper Quad），一些学生称它为“军事校园”，它也是学校士官团的兵营。
在黑堡主校区，绝大多数的建筑物都采取霍奇石（英语：Hokie Stone）（Hokie Stone）作为主要建筑材料。在20世纪90年代，一位校监事会成员强烈建议从此全部学校主校区建筑物必须参用霍奇石。2010年，校监事会通过决议将此意愿成为一项正式的学校政策[60]。
霍奇石通常是灰色，参合着棕色与粉红。这种石灰岩通常来自西南弗吉尼亚、田纳西州和阿拉巴马州的采矿场，1950年代，其中一家被学校购买运行。尽管校园中绝大多数建筑设计采用了霍奇石，但也有一些例外。比如在上四方楼区的全部建筑，都由红砖建成。此外，一些教学楼也没有采用霍奇石，因为它们在修建时，学校并没有对新建筑物做出强制要求。
弗吉尼亚理工大学有五个分校区[61]：
加勒比教育和研究中心（the Caribbean Center for Education and Research (CCER)）位于多米尼加共和国东部蓬塔卡纳，提供弗吉尼亚理工大学教授及学生从事生物多样性、环境、社会可持续性、全球自然资源问题、酒店和旅游管理。这一中心由弗吉尼亚理工大学、蓬塔卡纳生态基金会（PUNTACANA Ecological Foundation (PCEF) ）和蓬塔卡纳度假村合作建立[67]。
2014年，斯蒂格国际学者中心更名为欧洲研究和建筑中心（the Center for European Studies and Architecture (CESA)）[68]，成为弗吉尼亚理工大学在欧洲的校园，并在该区域从事项目运行和支持。改中心位于瑞士提契诺州圣维塔莱河村，距离意大利米兰等北部城市不远[67].
超过9000名学生居住在学校中，绝大多数的宿舍位于德里尔操场的西南侧，如今有29个宿舍楼提供给本科和研究生使用。
学校为单身的研究生和学者提供在校住宿，并且不允许携带家属和家庭[69]。
在1932年之前，每一位健全的男性学生都要求在四年学习期间加入弗吉尼亚理工大学学员团（英语：Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets）。1942年，这一要求压缩到了两年，并且参与必须自愿。弗吉尼亚理工大学也是当今仍然保留完整学员团制度（包括活跃的学员团及“平民化”生活方式）的三所学校之一，其他两所是德州农工大学和北佐治亚大学（英语：University of North Georgia）。
弗吉尼亚理工大学的学员团有超过1000名学员，并且有正式的军营。军营活动位于具有历史传统的上四方楼区。这一地区拥有学校最老的几栋建筑，它们可以追溯到19世纪晚期。
弗吉尼亚理工大学运动队被称之为“霍奇（Hokies）”，除了游泳队采用一个变体“H2Okies”。它是全美大学体育协会的甲级联赛（英语：Division I (NCAA)）成员。自从2004-2005赛季后，它参加大西洋沿岸联盟；而2000-2001年至2003-2004赛季时，它参加大东部联盟（英语：Big East Conference (1979–2013)）；在1995-1996年赛季至1999-2000年赛季，它是大西洋十大联盟（英语：Atlantic 10 Conference）成员；在1978-1979年赛季至1994-1995年赛季，它是地铁联盟（英语：Metro Conference）成员。
它的男子运动队包括有棒球、篮球、越野赛、橄榄球、高尔夫、英式足球、游泳&跳水、网球、田径和举重；而女子队包括棒球、越野赛、短曲棍球、高尔夫、长曲棍球、划船、英式足球、垒球、游泳&跳水、网球、田径和网球。
霍奇鸟（英语：HokieBird）（HokieBird）是一个土鸡样的生物，它来源于最初学校的吉祥物——战斗的火鸡（英语：Fighting Gobbler）。尽管当今的霍奇鸟仍然与“战斗的火鸡”相似，但是已经取代后者，成为更常见的口语用法。而时尚化的VT写法（Virginia Tech的缩写），也被用做弗吉尼亚理工运动队的标志，并被学校注册成为商标。
在早期VPI时期，最激烈的一项竞争是VPI和弗吉尼亚军事学院。这一竞争后来演化为“南方军事经典”（Military Classic of the South），在感恩节那一天，两校在弗吉尼亚州罗诺克进行橄榄球赛。1978年，全美大学体育协会将橄榄球联赛分区。弗吉尼亚军事学院选择加入甲级联赛-AA（英语：Division I-AA）界别（现在的甲级FCS），而两校因为学生容量导致竞技水平产生不平衡，导致这一竞赛传统在1984年赛季后结束。另一个长期并重要的体育竞赛是在弗吉尼亚理工大学与弗吉尼亚大学之间，弗吉尼亚-弗吉尼亚理工竞争（英语：Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry）随着两校在20世纪60和70年代的发展而加强，并成为霍奇队的主要体育竞争赛事之一。两校橄榄球队每赛季都在“联邦杯”（Commonwealth Cup）上竞赛。
弗吉尼亚理工的战歌《理工的胜利（英语：Tech Triumph）》，写于1919年，并保留至今。在体育赛事中，弗吉尼亚理工大学乐队“行军中的弗吉尼亚人（英语：The Marching Virginians）”和士官团军乐队（英语：Highty-Tighties），都会在体育赛事中演奏《理工的胜利》。而1896年的《老霍奇（英语：Old Hokie）》也被保留至今，用于各种场合的欢呼和庆祝。
1872年建校以来，弗吉尼亚农业和工业学院、弗吉尼亚理工大学为美国政治、经济、工程、建筑领域培养了大量校友，同时也极大地提高了学校成为全球著名大学的声望[70]。

Endowment value per student was $21,435.Virginia Cooperative Extension is a dynamic organization that stimulates positive personal and societal change leading to more productive lives, families, farms, and forests, as well as a better environment. Extension responds to the needs of individuals, families, groups, and organizations with educational programs in three broad areas: agriculture and natural resources, family and consumer sciences, and 4-H youth development.Extension, operated jointly in the commonwealth by Virginia Tech and Virginia State University, has been helping people improve their economic, cultural, and social well-being for almost 100 years. While Extension has a long history of helping make America's agricultural powerhouse more productive and economical, it also does important work in the state's urban and rural areas — from helping expectant mothers learn healthy nutritional practices to counseling families in financial distress. With offices, professionals, and volunteers positioned around the commonwealth, Extension's nonformal education benefits more than 1 million participants annually. Extension has touched virtually every life in the state in some way.Extension is a product of cooperation among local, state, and federal governments in partnership with thousands of citizens who, through local Extension Leadership Councils, help design, implement, and evaluate Cooperative Extension's needs-driven programs.The shield embodies Virginia Tech's motto — Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) — by incorporating an image of the university's War Memorial Pylons, where this motto is etched in stone.The shield's shape also reflects the collegiate heritage of all universities, and the numerals "1872" recognize the year the university was founded and reinforce the traditions of long-standing service to the Commonwealth of Virginia.The shield was adopted in May 1991. The four quadrants of the shield on the seal depict the obverse side of the Great Seal of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the surveyor's level and leveling rod superimposed over a scroll, a partially husked standing ear of corn, and a chemical retort and graduate. Above the shield is the left side of the flaming lamp of learning with a right hand suspended above it.The seal, created in 1896 and officially adopted by the board of visitors in 1963, has remained unchanged (with the exception of the name of the institution and the alteration of the commonwealth portion) for more than 11 decades and reflects the agricultural/mechanical emphasis in the Virginia Tech curriculum during its first century.Designed in 1965 by the late Col. Harry D. Temple (industrial engineering '34) when he was commanding officer of the Army's Institute of Heraldry, the coat of arms was granted to the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets by the U.S. Army. The symbols are as follows:The HokieBird, the university mascot, evolved from a live turkey paraded on the playing field to a hand-sewn costume with a papier-mâché head to today's professionally manufactured outfit. A costumed mascot, which eventually evolved into HokieBird, first took the field in the fall of 1962.In 1913, Floyd Meade, a local resident nicknamed "Hard Times," who was chosen by the student body to serve as the team's mascot, trained a large turkey that he could make gobble on command at games. Although the nickname "Gobblers" had been used sporadically for about 10 years, fans and sports writers enthusiastically began to use it regularly.The term "Hokie" was coined by O.M. Stull (Class of 1896) when he wrote the "Old Hokie" spirit yell, first used in the fall of 1896 ("Hoki, Hoki, Hoki, Hy / Techs! Techs! VPI"). Fans started calling Tech teams "Hokies" as well as "Fightin' Gobblers," but the latter nickname prevailed. In the 1980s, a football coach who didn't like the gobbler image encouraged the use of the nickname Hokies, and the two names evolved into the HokieBird.For the purpose of salary comparisons, the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia identifies institutions with academic profiles similar to Virginia Tech's.Virginia Tech is consistently recognized for its value and the quality of its programs. These rankings represent a few of the broader measures of excellence that the university garners.© 2014 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University

© 2014 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University7 Jan 2019Cyril Clarke, interim executive vice president and provost and former dean of the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, has been named Virginia Tech’s permanent executive vice president and provost.Virginia Tech President Tim Sands announced Clarke’s selection following an international search involving several in-person and on-campus candidate interviews. Clarke assumed his permanent role on Jan. 1, 2019.“I am honored to have Cyril join us as the EVP and provost at such a pivotal time in our history,” Sands said. “Under his guidance as interim provost, we have advanced the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative, integrated the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine into Virginia Tech, launched the Calhoun Honors Discovery Program at the Honors College, and contributed to attracting Amazon to Northern Virginia with the higher education package that features the Virginia Tech Innovation Campus. It is leadership like Cyril’s that will allow us to achieve our highest aspirations.”Sands appointed Clarke to serve as interim executive vice president and provost when Thanassis Rikakis stepped down in November 2017 to take a position as Presidential Fellow for Academic Innovation and executive director of the Calhoun Center for Higher Education Innovation. During his interim appointment, Clarke  focused on advancing the university’s Beyond Boundaries vision and engaging the academic community in foundational initiatives that began under former provost Rikakis’ leadership, such as Destination Areas and the Partnership for an Incentive-Based Budget (PIBB).Serving as chief academic officer and lead for the institution’s academic enterprise, Clarke will continue to work closely with Sands, college deans, and administrators across the campus to advance cross-disciplinary initiatives; continue to build the institution’s research enterprise; and position Virginia Tech as a 21st-century global land-grant university.“As interim executive vice president and provost, I have focused on engaging our academic community in advancing President Sands’ Beyond Boundaries vision and the foundational initiatives that are creating comprehensive growth opportunities for Virginia Tech,” Clarke said. “I am honored to be able to continue this collaborative work with faculty and academic leaders in every college and every department and to help Virginia Tech serve the commonwealth as we achieve global distinction. I look forward to leading Virginia Tech’s academic enterprise and partnering with this amazing community of academicians and researchers.”A native of Johannesburg, South Africa, Clarke earned his professional veterinary degree from the University of Pretoria, South Africa, in 1981, a Ph.D. in veterinary pharmacology from Louisiana State University in 1987, and an M.S. in higher education from Oklahoma State University in 2000. He is certified as a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Clinical Pharmacology.Clarke’s leadership in veterinary medicine has spanned several professional organizations, including the Board of Directors for the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges and past president of the American College of Veterinary Clinical Pharmacology. He is also a past member of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, Education, and Economics Advisory Board and the AVMA Council on Education, the accrediting agency for veterinary medical education in North America.Before leading Virginia Tech’s academic enterprise as executive vice president and provost, Clarke served as dean of the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. In that role, he launched a degree in public health, the college’s first undergraduate degree program. The degree is an integral component of the college’s One Health initiative, which recognizes the close linkages between animal health, human health, and the environment, and is reflected in the college’s engagement with the developing health sciences and technology program in Roanoke, in partnership with Carilion Clinic.“The strength of the provost candidates we invited to campus signaled the academic credibility and reputation of Virginia Tech,” said Rosemary Blieszner, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, Alumni Distinguished Professor, and chair of the search committee for the executive vice president and provost. “I am thrilled to have my fellow dean and colleague serve as Virginia Tech’s next provost, knowing that Cyril is clearly the best in the country to lead us at this time.”From his first day as interim provost, Clarke has actively engaged the campus, advancing the university’s vision and foundational initiatives and soliciting ideas and feedback from faculty and staff. He plans to continue this direct communication and partnership with the academic community,  working collaboratively with them to create new opportunities for Virginia Tech throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia.Going forward, he will focus on listening to the campus community, leveraging ideas, experiences, and expertise to build strategic areas of excellence that are distinctive, relevant, effective, and sustainable."I have worked closely with Cyril Clarke through my engagement with the Board of Visitors and my service to the Faculty Senate,” said John Ferris, president of the Faculty Senate and associate professor of mechanical engineering in the College of Engineering. “Cyril brings to the provost position a reflective, deliberate, and inclusive approach that supports the faculty's stewardship of the university's academic mission, which will ensure that we are a first choice for the best and the brightest academics in the world. Cyril has been a strong faculty advocate and partner in his interim capacity, and I look forward to continuing to work with him in the years to come.”Clarke’s leadership extends beyond Virginia Tech’s academic enterprise. As co-chair of the Educational Programs and Experiential Learning working group for the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI), he helped design a plan to advance talent development across Virginia.“Virginia Tech is on the move and needs strong academic leadership with the courage and conviction to do what is right for Virginia Tech in its service to the commonwealth,” said Dennis Treacy, rector of the Board of Visitors. “I have seen first-hand these qualities in Cyril over the past year, and I am excited about the strategic leadership partnership of Tim Sands and Cyril Clarke. I am confident that together they will develop new opportunities, make great economic impacts, and move Virginia Tech forward at such an important time in our history.”Clarke is a respected resource for Virginia Tech’s Board of Visitors, actively engaging them in discussions and strategies for advancing the academic enterprise. In his permanent role, Clarke will continue to be a collaborative partner with the board, serving as a voice and advocate for faculty and staff in academic leadership and programming matters.“The development of the Academic Health Center and the university’s strategic growth in Roanoke have benefitted greatly from the support and leadership of Cyril Clarke, initially in his role as dean of the college of veterinary medicine, where he contributed to our planning for the new Biomedical Research Addition, and subsequently in his role as interim provost where he served as a strong and effective voice for the originally conceived VTCRI and its recent transformation to the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC,” said Michael Friedlander, executive director of the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC and vice president for health sciences and technology.“With the continuity and vision of leadership from Provost Clarke and President Sands, we are strongly positioned to continue the forward momentum we have created to improve human and animal health through innovative approaches to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease and to contribute to sustainable economic vitality of the region,” Friedlander said.  With Clarke’s permanent appointment as executive vice present and provost, Virginia Tech will launch a national search to permanently fill the position of dean of the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, vacated by Clarke in November 2017.Greg Daniel currently serves as interim dean of the college, and together with its leadership team, has ensured its continued growth and development of programs that place it at the forefront of veterinary medical education.  The college recently announced the most diverse and competitive applicant pool for the DVM program in its history, and construction of a new Comparative Oncology Research Center in Roanoke is underway.

                            © 2013 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University26 Apr 2020With funding provided through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Virginia Tech will immediately allocate $9.7 million to emergency financial aid grants for eligible students. These funds will support the university’s ongoing efforts to assist students who are experiencing financial hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.“The changes that have been required to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect our communities have hit financially vulnerable students and their families especially hard,” said Virginia Tech President Tim Sands. “The $9.7 million CARES financial aid allocation is an important addition to the university’s existing support programs and will be passed directly to students as quickly as we can make it happen.”On April 9, the U.S. secretary of education announced plans to distribute aid approved by Congress to universities to support costs associated with the educational impacts of shifting classes to online formats and for grants to students for food, housing, technology, and other purposes. The U.S. Department of Education notified institutions of these amounts with an expectation that it be delivered to students with needs as soon as possible.The $9.7 million in CARES Act support that Virginia Tech will receive is based on total student enrollment and is also weighted for the number of Pell grant eligible students. In fall 2019, Virginia Tech had a total enrollment of 29,300 undergraduate students and 7,083 graduate students. There are 4,274 students who are Pell grant eligible, which represents 14.6 percent of total undergraduate enrollment.“We recognize the unprecedented financial challenges and life changes the COVID-19 situation has presented for many of our undergraduate and graduate students, and we’ll continue to provide any support we can to help them through this difficult time,” said Executive Vice President and Provost Cyril Clarke. “The CARES Act funding offers us another opportunity to increase our ongoing assistance to students impacted by the pandemic and to help them refocus their attention and energy on achieving their academic goals. Whether on-campus or online, we are fully committed to the welfare and success of our students.”Prior to the allocation of this federal funding, Virginia Tech was actively assisting students with a variety of emergency needs. The university is continuing this support through the Student Emergency Fund, which is administered by the Dean of Students Office, through assistance provided by the Student Opportunity and Achievement Resources (SOAR) program, and through direct appeals for additional financial aid through the Office of University Scholarships and Financial Aid.Virginia Tech will distribute this additional CARES Act-supported financial aid to both undergraduate and graduate students through a process of formula-driven distributions and expanded individual emergency support. In an effort to get relief into the hands of students and families as soon as possible, Virginia Tech will distribute the majority of the student aid support based on a formula. The formula will consider factors that include Pell grant eligibility and prior borrowing from direct subsidized or alternative loan programs.“The support we are able to offer to individual students through these programs, as they currently exist, is constrained in both the number of students we can help and the level of assistance we can provide,” said Luisa Havens Gerardo, vice provost for enrollment management. “Nevertheless, the infusion of these additional funds under the CARES Act does create an opportunity for the university to increase the number of students receiving assistance and expand the type of needs we can help alleviate.”These grants will be awarded as soon as the institution has access to the federal funding. Grants will be disbursed to student accounts resulting in the issuance of a payment directly to the student. The university will initiate payment to the student by direct deposit to the bank account on file or by check mailed to the student’s permanent address of record. Students who do not have direct deposit may experience a delay in receiving their payment. Those who wish to sign up for direct deposit should do so though HokieSpa.In addition to these formula-driven allocations, Virginia Tech will use a portion of the CARES Act funding to address various individual emergency needs as they are identified. A portion of the CARES Act funding will supplement the emergency relief funds of the university. Prior to receiving CARES Act funding, Virginia Tech had proactively provided financial support and relief to students to include expanding the Student Emergency Fund, refunds to students vacating on-campus housing, and rebates to parking and other select physical campus fees. The university is continuing to discuss and plan for programs to assist students during FY21.Both undergraduate and graduate students with needs, and faculty and staff who learn of students with COVID-19 related emergency financial needs should contact the Dean of Students Office at (540) 231-3787 or dean.students@vt.edu. The Dean of Students Office, in consultation with other student support offices and the office of university scholarships and financial aid, will evaluate each individual case and make appropriate additional awards of individual assistance from available emergency funds. This support is above and beyond the formula-driven awards described above.University updates and information related to COVID-19 and the various resources and forms and support and assistance available to students can be found on the Virginia Tech website.

Virginia Tech demonstrates impact as a global land grant – progressing sustainability in our community, through the Commonwealth of Virginia, and around the world.Get Directions See All Locations Contact Virginia Tech For the media © 2023 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. All rights reserved.April 26, 2020With funding provided through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Virginia Tech will immediately allocate $9.7 million to emergency financial aid grants for eligible students. These funds will support the university’s ongoing efforts to assist students who are experiencing financial hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.“The changes that have been required to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect our communities have hit financially vulnerable students and their families especially hard,” said Virginia Tech President Tim Sands. “The $9.7 million CARES financial aid allocation is an important addition to the university’s existing support programs and will be passed directly to students as quickly as we can make it happen.”On April 9, the U.S. secretary of education announced plans to distribute aid approved by Congress to universities to support costs associated with the educational impacts of shifting classes to online formats and for grants to students for food, housing, technology, and other purposes. The U.S. Department of Education notified institutions of these amounts with an expectation that it be delivered to students with needs as soon as possible.The $9.7 million in CARES Act support that Virginia Tech will receive is based on total student enrollment and is also weighted for the number of Pell grant eligible students. In fall 2019, Virginia Tech had a total enrollment of 29,300 undergraduate students and 7,083 graduate students. There are 4,274 students who are Pell grant eligible, which represents 14.6 percent of total undergraduate enrollment.“We recognize the unprecedented financial challenges and life changes the COVID-19 situation has presented for many of our undergraduate and graduate students, and we’ll continue to provide any support we can to help them through this difficult time,” said Executive Vice President and Provost Cyril Clarke. “The CARES Act funding offers us another opportunity to increase our ongoing assistance to students impacted by the pandemic and to help them refocus their attention and energy on achieving their academic goals. Whether on-campus or online, we are fully committed to the welfare and success of our students.”Prior to the allocation of this federal funding, Virginia Tech was actively assisting students with a variety of emergency needs. The university is continuing this support through the Student Emergency Fund, which is administered by the Dean of Students Office, through assistance provided by the Student Opportunity and Achievement Resources (SOAR) program, and through direct appeals for additional financial aid through the Office of University Scholarships and Financial Aid.Virginia Tech will distribute this additional CARES Act-supported financial aid to both undergraduate and graduate students through a process of formula-driven distributions and expanded individual emergency support. In an effort to get relief into the hands of students and families as soon as possible, Virginia Tech will distribute the majority of the student aid support based on a formula. The formula will consider factors that include Pell grant eligibility and prior borrowing from direct subsidized or alternative loan programs.“The support we are able to offer to individual students through these programs, as they currently exist, is constrained in both the number of students we can help and the level of assistance we can provide,” said Luisa Havens Gerardo, vice provost for enrollment management. “Nevertheless, the infusion of these additional funds under the CARES Act does create an opportunity for the university to increase the number of students receiving assistance and expand the type of needs we can help alleviate.”These grants will be awarded as soon as the institution has access to the federal funding. Grants will be disbursed to student accounts resulting in the issuance of a payment directly to the student. The university will initiate payment to the student by direct deposit to the bank account on file or by check mailed to the student’s permanent address of record. Students who do not have direct deposit may experience a delay in receiving their payment. Those who wish to sign up for direct deposit should do so though HokieSpa.In addition to these formula-driven allocations, Virginia Tech will use a portion of the CARES Act funding to address various individual emergency needs as they are identified.

Ever since then, Virginia Tech has been fulfilling its role as a leading land-grant university. The tiny college, originally housed in the old Olin and Preston Institute near what is now Alumni Mall, has grown into a world-class university.Discover Virginia Tech’s rich history and traditions through our heritage as a leading university from 1872 to the present.What is a “Hokie”?Colors and mascotAthletics traditionsThe Corps of CadetsCampus buildings and memorialsMotto, seal, and logosMore historyIn the 1890s, a student named O.M. Stull, Class of 1896, won a $5 prize for coming up with a new spirit cheer, now known as “Old Hokie.” The original went:Hoki, Hoki, Hoki, Hy.
 Techs, Techs, V.P.I.
 Sola-Rex, Sola-Rah.
 Polytechs - Vir-gin-ia.
 Rae, Ri, V.P.I.Later, an “e” was added to “Hoki” to make “Hokie,” and “Team! Team! Team!” was attached to the end.What’s in a name?Significant academic changes in 1896 ushered in a new name more befitting the university’s higher profile — Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute, commonly known as Virginia Polytechnic Institute, or VPI.Virginia Tech colorsDuring 1896, a committee was formed to find a suitable combination of colors to replace the original colors of black and gray, which made athletic uniforms resemble prison garb. The committee selected burnt orange and Chicago maroon because no other college was using that particular color combination.Burnt orange and Chicago maroon was first worn during a football game against Roanoke College on October 26, 1896.Hokies were once called “Gobblers,” a nickname whose origin is widely disputed. One story claims it resulted from the way student athletes would “gobble” up their food.The name was already popular when Floyd Meade, a local resident, trained a large turkey to pull a cart at a football game in 1913. Throughout the years, trained turkeys would continue to gobble on command and perform stunts. In 1962, a student raised $200 for a costume; the result was an unusual turkey with a cardinal-like head, known as the Gobbler and then the Fighting Gobbler.When the Gobbler nickname fell out of favor, student George Wills sketched new designs for a class project. The updated mascot appeared at a football game in September 1981. The current HokieBird, which conveys power and strength, debuted in September 1987.Did you know? Students who dress as the HokieBird remain anonymous until commencement, when they reveal their secret by wearing HokieBird feet during the procession into Lane Stadium.Fight song

“Tech Triumph,” the university's most popular fight song, was composed in 1919 by Wilfred P. Maddux (Class of 1920) and his neighbor, Mattie Eppes. It was officially adopted by the student body in December 1919.Techmen, we’re Techmen, with spirit true and faithful,
 Backing up our teams with hopes undying;
 Techmen, oh, Techmen, we’re out to win today,
 Showing “pep” and life with which we’re trying;
 V.P., old V.P., you know our hearts are with you
 In our luck which never seems to die;
 Win or lose, we’ll greet you with a glad returning,
 You’re the pride of V.P.I.Chorus:
 Just watch our men so big and active
 Support the Orange and Maroon. Let’s go Techs.
 We know our ends and backs are stronger,
 With winning hopes, we fear defeat no longer.
 To see our team plow through the line, boys.
 Determined now to win or die:
 So give a Hokie, Hokie, Hokie, Hy,
 Rae, Ri, old V.P.I."Alma Mater"

The "Alma Mater" was born in spring 1939 when Ernest T. Sparks (Class of 1940) composed music and L.G. Chase (Class of 1941) wrote lyrics for a student contest.Verse:
 Sing praise to Alma Mater dear,
 For V.P.I. we'll ever cheer;
 Come lift your voices, swell the song,
 Our loyalties to her belong.Chorus:
 So stand and sing, all hail to thee.
 VT, all hail to thee.Verse:
 The Orange and Maroon you see,
 That’s fighting on to victory;
 Our strife will not be long this day,
 For glory lies within this fray.Verse:
 All loyal sons and daughters, one,
 We raise our banner to the sun;
 Our motto brings a spirit true,
 That we may ever serve you.“Enter Sandman”

Written and recorded by the heavy metal band Metallica, “Enter Sandman” has been played in Lane Stadium since 2000 as the football team enters the field. The tradition of students jumping up and down during the song started on December 1, 2001, when a Marching Virginians band member started jumping during the song and was joined by his colleagues. The tradition eventually spread to the basketball teams’ entrances in Cassell Coliseum.The lunch pail

The famed Virginia Tech lunch pail symbolizes the blue-collar approach of the Hokies’ football defense, developed by assistant head coach and defensive coordinator Bud Foster. Foster’s Lunch Pail Defense Foundation provides scholarships for high school students from the New River and Roanoke valleys, as well as assisting the families of those awaiting organ transplants.In 1995, the original lunch pail was acquired by the mother-in-law of co-defensive coordinator Rod Sharpless. The pail once belonged to a coal miner, and after the record-setting defensive season, the lunch pail became an iconic element of the Hokie football lore. The battered and rusting pail, which now contains the names of the 32 Hokies who died in the tragedy on April 16, 2007, travels wherever the Hokies go, and its care is entrusted to a defensive leader.Game-Ball Run

Ranger Company, the Army ROTC company, has performed the Game-Ball Run every year since 1977, although the tradition likely originated with the Virginia Tech-VMI football games years before that.Members of Ranger Company run the game ball for 100 miles around campus during the week of the annual homecoming football game and then hold a ceremony the day of the game, which includes running the ball into the stadium.Firing cannons: Skipper

At a football game against Virginia Military Institute (VMI), two cadets from the Class of 1964 made a pact that they would build a cannon to outshine — or outblast — VMI’s “Little John.” The cadets, Homer Hadley “Sonny” Hickam (of “October Sky” fame) and Alton B. “Butch” Harper Jr., collected brass from fellow cadets and added it to metal provided by Hickam’s father. On its first firing, the eager cadets tripled the charge, which blew the hats off half the VMI Keydets and shook the glass in the pressbox windows of Roanoke’s Victory Stadium.
“Skipper” is named for President John F. Kennedy, who had been a PT-boat skipper. Today, Skipper is fired at football games and for other notable occasions.The first known organized competition against an off-campus team occurred in 1877 when the VAMC baseball team, which probably included townspeople, played Roanoke College and won by a record score of 53-13.The first effort to formalize athletic activities came in fall 1891 when the VAMC Athletic Association was established. The following year, a football team and tennis association were added. In one long-running and affectionately remembered football tradition, Tech played VMI in Roanoke on Thanksgiving Day for nearly 75 years.Women finally joined the athletics fold in 1970 with a swimming team. Women’s basketball followed in 1972.The Hokies have been a member of several conferences over the years. They joined the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2004. NCAA Division I-A men’s varsity sports at Tech are football, basketball, baseball, soccer, indoor and outdoor track, swimming and diving, wrestling, tennis, golf, and cross country. Women’s varsity sports are basketball, tennis, volleyball, swimming and diving, indoor and outdoor track, soccer, softball, lacrosse, golf, and cross country.The Student-Athlete Performance Center benefits recruiting, nutrition, and performance for all 22 varsity sports. And in 2021-22 academic year, over 350 of the university's student-athletes earned GPAs above 3.0.
Our oldest traditionThe Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets became official in the 1890s, drawing from the university’s origin in 1872 and its required military training for students. As the university changed and innovated, so did the corps. Mandated four-year participation in the corps for all males changed to two years in 1923 — the same year women were first admitted — and then participation became voluntary in 1964.
Today, Virginia Tech is one of three public universities in the country with both an active corps of cadets and a “civilian” lifestyle on its campus.Upper Quad
Centered in Virginia Tech’s early history, the university’s Upper Quad has long been the home of the Corps of Cadets. Lane Hall, completed in 1888, is a state and national historic landmark originally known as Barracks No. 1. In front of the hall is an orange and maroon sidewalk that forms the largest “VT” on campus.In recent updates, Pearson and New Cadet halls have replaced older cadet residence halls, and a new plaza between the halls displays the Corps’ monuments, honoring those who have served in the past and present.Marching in memory of Caldwell

The Corps of Cadets pay homage to the university’s beginnings and celebrate the progress of first-year cadets by retracing the walk Add Caldwell took from Craig County. Cadets cover the first 13 miles in the fall and the second 13 miles in the spring to mark the end to the first year of training.Hokie StoneVirginia Tech exhibits its character and pride every day via its buildings, most of which are made of Hokie Stone, a limestone common in Southwest Virginia. It was first used in campus building construction in 1899, and today, all new central campus buildings must bear the distinctive stone.Hewed by hand and varying from grays, browns, and blacks to pinks, oranges, and maroons, no two stones are the same color. Since the mid-1950s, the university has operated its own quarry.The Pylons and War Memorial Chapel
One of the most important and symbolic structures on campus, The Pylons above War Memorial Chapel bear the names of every Virginia Tech student and graduate who died defending our nation’s freedom, beginning with those lost during World War I. The Pylons evoke Virginia Tech’s core values. From left to right, they represent Brotherhood, Honor, Leadership, Sacrifice, Service, Loyalty, Duty, and Ut Prosim.


At the memorial’s center, the cenotaph displays the names of Virginia Tech’s seven Medal of Honor recipients.
April 16 Memorial
The April 16 Memorial, located on the Drillfield, remembers the 32 university community members who lost their lives on April 16, 2007.
The Hokie Stone symbolizes our relentless spirit, our courage to move forward, and our determination never to forget.
Gargoyles and grotesques
Their hunched bodies and contorted faces are the stuff of Hokie legend. At least 15 “gargoyles” at Virginia Tech fit right into our neo-Gothic architecture. And for some students, finding every one of them before graduation is a rite of passage.Functional gargoyles are waterspouts that move water away from the roof of a building. So while the “cowgoyles” of Saunders Hall might not function as waterspouts, they are a beloved decorative element.List of known gargoyles:In 1896, the university adopted Ut Prosim, Latin for "That I May Serve," as its motto, and a college seal was developed. The Virginia Tech Board of Visitors did not officially adopt the seal, which is still used, until 1963.In 1991, Virginia Tech adopted a university logo, which incorporates an image of the War Memorial with its eight pylons, each representing a different virtue.The inclusion of the numerals “1872,” the founding year of the university, reinforces the traditions of more than a century of service to the Commonwealth of Virginia, the nation, and the world.In 2017, a new brand platform and accompanying logo were launched. The new Virginia Tech mark is grounded in tradition, yet focused on the future. The lettering reflects our VT-shaped educational experience.The vertical bar of the T represents disciplinary depth, while the horizontal bar reflects the ability to work across disciplines. The arms of the V represent experiential learning and the spirit of Ut Prosim. The logo’s openness and shape highlight Virginia Tech’s identity as an inclusive community that thrives at the intersection of disciplines.The university also has an athletic logo: a streamlined “VT,” which is used only for sports and sports merchandise. Unveiled in 1984, the athletic logo is a composite of designs submitted by two Virginia Tech students to a competition sponsored by the university’s art department.Firming and building the foundationsJohn M. McBryde laid the foundations for modern-day Virginia Tech in the 1890s, including the development of B.S. degrees and graduate study, granting permanent status for the Corps of Cadets, and starting the athletics program. McBryde and his son also developed the university’s motto: Ut Prosim (That I May Serve).T. Marshall Hahn Jr. transformed VPI from college status to a major research university in the 1960s and 1970s. He championed the development of a university education and led the movement to create the research division. The student body tripled, and eight residence halls and 10 other major facilities were added.Charles W. Steger expertly guided the university’s growth and scope during the first 14 years of the 2000s. Research funding and private fundraising increased. He established the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute and a school of biomedical engineering. He was a visionary leader for the Moss Arts Center and in elevating Virginia Tech’s presence in Northern Virginia.Colleges across the country offer students the chance to buy a class ring, but very few annually redesign the ring to be unique to each class. This tradition began at Virginia Tech in 1911-12, and the resulting ring always invokes memories, traditions, and pride.Each year, the sophomore class selects a Ring Committee to design their ring collection, which always includes the screaming eagle, American flag, campus buildings, and an interlocking chain around the bezel. From there, the Ring Committee incorporates characteristics unique to its class.Since 1934, couples have exchanged rings at the Virginia Tech Ring Dance to the tune of “Moonlight and VPI,” written specifically for the Ring Dance by composer Fred Waring and lyricist Charles Gaynor.Get Directions  See All Locations  Contact Virginia Tech  © 2023 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Virginia Tech / About All about Hokie StoneWhat is a Hokie? The origin of the word "Hokie" has nothing to do with a turkey. It was coined by O.M. Stull (class of 1896), who used it in a spirit yell he wrote for a competition.Here's how that competition came to be. Virginia Tech was founded in 1872 as a land-grant institution and was named Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College. In 1896, the Virginia General Assembly officially changed the college's name to Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute, a name so long that people shortened it in popular usage to VPI. The original college cheer, which made reference to the original name of the institution, was no longer suitable. So a contest was held to select a new spirit yell, and Stull won the $5 top prize for his cheer, now known as Old Hokie:Hoki, Hoki, Hoki, Hy.
Techs, Techs, V.P.I.
Sola-Rex, Sola-Rah.
Polytechs - Vir-gin-ia.
Rae, Ri, V.P.I.Later, the phrase "Team! Team! Team!" was added at the end, and an "e" was added to "Hoki."Since the university had a new name and a new yell, new college colors seemed to be a desirable next step. During 1896, a committee was formed to find a suitable combination of colors to replace the original colors of black and gray, which appeared in stripes on athletic uniforms and presented an image resembling prison uniforms.The committee selected burnt orange and Chicago maroon after discovering that no other college utilized this particular combination of colors. Burnt orange and Chicago maroon were officially adopted and were first worn during a football game versus nearby Roanoke College on Oct. 26, 1896.Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University officially opened on Oct. 1, 1872, as Virginia’s white land-grant institution (Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute, founded in 1868, was designated the commonwealth's first black land-grant school. This continued until 1920, when the funds were shifted by the legislature to the Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute in Petersburg, which in 1946 was renamed to Virginia State University by the legislature). During its existence, the university has operated under four different legal names. The founding name was Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College. Following a reorganization of the college in the 1890s, the state legislature changed the name to Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute, effective March 5, 1896. Faced with such an unwieldy name, people began calling it Virginia Polytechnic Institute, or simply VPI. On June 23, 1944, the legislature followed suit, officially changing the name to Virginia Polytechnic Institute. At the same time, the commonwealth moved most women’s programs from VPI to nearby Radford College, and that school’s official name became Radford College, Women’s Division of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The commonwealth dissolved the affiliation between the two colleges in 1964. The state legislature sanctioned university status for VPI and bestowed upon it the present legal name, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, effective June 26, 1970. While some older alumni and other friends of the university continue to call it VPI, its most popular–and its official—nickname today is Virginia Tech.Also in 1896, the university adopted Ut Prosim, Latin for "That I May Serve," as its motto, and a college seal was developed. The Virginia Tech Board of Visitors did not officially adopt the seal, which is still used, until 1963.In 1991, Virginia Tech adopted a university logo, which incorporates an image of the War Memorial with its eight pylons, each representing a different virtue. The inclusion of the numerals "1872," the founding year of the university, reinforces the traditions of more than a century of service to the Commonwealth of Virginia, the nation, and the world.The former university logo was updated in 2006 after a yearlong study by a branding consultant, who worked closely with the university community to develop a representative tagline for Virginia Tech. That tagline — Invent the Future — expressed the future-altering and future-enhancing work of each facet of the Virginia Tech experience.In 2017, a new brand platform and accompanying logo was launched, while the former logo and tagline were retired. More can be read about the new platform at the brand site.  The university also has an athletic logo: a streamlined “VT,” which is used only for sports and sports merchandise. Unveiled in 1984, the athletic logo is a composite of designs submitted by two Virginia Tech art students — Lisa Eichler of Chesapeake, Va., and Chris Craft of Roanoke, Va. — to a competition sponsored by the university's art department. It replaced an older athletic logo that consisted of a large “V” with a “T” centered inside it, which had debuted in 1957.The origin of the term "Gobblers" is disputed, with one story claiming it was coined in the early 1900s as a description of how student athletes would "gobble" up their more than ample servings of food. Another story attributes it to the fact that the 1909 football coach, Branch Bocock, wanted to stimulate better spirit amongst his players and initiated them into an impromptu and informal "Gobbler Club."Thus, the name was already popular when Floyd Meade, a local resident chosen by the student body to serve as the school's mascot, had a large turkey pull him in a cart at a football game in 1913. The school's president halted the cart after one game because he thought it was cruel to the turkey. Meade continued to parade his mascot, which he had trained to gobble on command, up and down the sidelines — and did so until another "turkey trainer" took over in 1924 to continue the tradition. Enthusiastic fans and sports writers adopted the "Gobbler" nickname and began to use it regularly.In 1936, a costumed Gobbler joined the live gobbler for at least one game. The use of a live gobbler mascot continued into the 1950s, and the first permanent costumed Gobbler took the field in the fall of 1962.But the "Gobbler" was not to last, at least in name. In the late 1970s, the university hired a football coach who heard the theory that the Gobbler mascot was based on athletes gobbling down their food. The coach didn't like the image, so he began promoting the "Hokie" nickname.In 1982, the appearance of the Gobbler mascot costume was changed to one that looked like a maroon cardinal with a snood, and references first appeared to it as "the Hokie mascot," "the Hokie," and "the Hokie bird." The costume worn by today's HokieBird made its first appearance in 1987. HokieBird has won national mascot competitions and has been so popular that the mascot landed an appearance on Animal Planet's "Turkey Secrets."Tech Triumph, the university's most popular fight song, was composed in 1919 by Wilfred P. Maddux (class of 1920) and his neighbor, Mattie Eppes. It was officially adopted by the student body in December 1919. Virginia Tech exhibits its character and pride every day via its buildings, most of which are made of Hokie Stone. It was first used in campus building construction in 1899. Hokie stone is actually a native limestone common in Southwest Virginia and parts of Tennessee and Alabama. No two stones are the same color, varying from grays, browns, and blacks to pinks, oranges, and maroons. Since the mid-1950s, the university has operated its own quarry, and the popular limestone appears on many of the university’s buildings.The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is another tradition that distinguishes the university, which required corps participation for every able-bodied male for four years until 1923 and then for two years until 1964, when it became voluntary. Virginia Tech remains one of three public universities in the country (Texas A&M and North Georgia College and State University are the others) with both an active corps of cadets and "civilian" lifestyle on its campus.The Corps of Cadets is considered by many to be the keeper of traditions at Virginia Tech. Probably the oldest tradition in the Corps is the Honor Code: A cadet will not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those that do. It has been central to the cadet experience for over a century. Many long-standing traditions have been modified over the years to reflect changes in society. One such custom is that of the junior-freshman mentor relationship. The tradition of "dyking"—slang for "decking", meaning decking out the junior cadet in formal uniform for Ring Dance—has evolved to today's mentoring program. The freshmen still help by supporting the juniors in all phases of getting ready for Ring Dance, but in today's leader development environment, juniors take on more of a mentoring role to help the freshmen navigate the challenges of their first cadet year.Another example of a continuing tradition that has been updated is that of Turn About Day, which is now called Shadow Day. In earlier days, Turn About Day was a day where the roles were reversed and the freshman class was in charge for one day, and all upperclassmen reverted to the freshman cadet role. Freshmen bid on upperclassman shirts for rank, bidding to become the company commander or regimental commander and the like, with the money going to charity. Today the same bidding process is conducted, with funds still going to a worthy cause—recently it went to the Matthew J. La Porte Scholarship in honor of the cadet lost on April 16th and to the Lauren Smith Scholarship in honor of the cadet who died last fall. The purpose of the event is to give each freshman a real glimpse into the responsibilities he or she will shoulder as they progress up the ranks. A relatively new tradition is the Caldwell March. This annual 26-mile hike has been conducted in two 13-mile segments annually since the year 2000. It recreates the trek made by Addison Caldwell as he went from his home in Craig County to the campus to register as the first student at the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1872.Devised as a way to introduce freshmen to their life as cadets, help turn them into adults and to keep them in line, the "rat" system was part of the Corps during the college's first 50 years. It was replaced in 1934 by a system of military and civilian rules. In the early years, sophomores dressed freshmen in a variety of costumes for an annual "rat parade," which featured rats marching through campus and town.Beginning no later than the 1960s, members of the Corps of Cadets have carried a Flaming VT through campus and sometimes into town before carting it to the Thursday night pep rallies, then held at the War Memorial. In the 1990s, the tradition was altered, and the cadets began carrying the Flaming VT to Homecoming pep rallies on Alumni Hall Lawn. The Flaming VT consists of a metal frame in the shape of a V with the T nested inside it. Toilet paper soaked in kerosene is woven through the frame and set ablaze.For more than fifty years of the early college, student discipline was often challenging for the administration and faculty. It occasionally was painful to the surrounding community and ultimately led to the removal of two early presidents. One tradition that emerged among the cadets was a single night of the year, Sophomore Night, during which "each succeeding class tried to outdo the preceding sophomores in the amount of mischief and destruction…" It came to a climax in 1925 when sophomores took cows to the top floor of the barracks, placed an assortment of farm vehicles and a horse drawn hearse on the roofs of barracks, brought two steam rollers from a highway construction job for a "bullfight," drove a grocery truck down a basement stairway, filled the quadrangle with numerous livestock, and hauled a fire hose reel up a flagpole. President Burruss' strong disciplinary action, that followed, ended forever the Sophomore Night tradition.Ranger Company, the Army ROTC company, has performed the Game-ball Run every year since 1977, although the tradition likely originated with the Virginia Tech-VMI football games years before that.This tradition consists of members of Ranger Company running the game ball for 100 miles around campus during the week of the annual Homecoming football game. The runners attend the Homecoming pep rally to rally the crowd and then hold a ceremony the day of the game, which includes running the ball into the stadium.Various cannons have been used off and on for years at Virginia Tech, but in the 1960s one industrious student formally proposed to the student governing body that a cannon be acquired to fire at football games. The proposal was approved but went no further.About the same time, two cadets from the class of 1964 made a pact at a traditional VPI-VMI Thanksgiving Day game that they would build a cannon for Virginia Tech (then known as VPI) to outshine — or outblast — Virginia Military Institute's "Little John." The cadets — Alton B. "Butch" Harper Jr. and Homer Hadley "Sonny" Hickam (of October Sky fame) — were tired of hearing VMI keydets chant "Where's your cannon?" after firing their own.Harper and Hickam collected brass from their fellow cadets, added it to metal donated by Hickam's father, collected donations from the corps to purchase other supplies, and used a mold created in one of the engineering departments from Civil War-style plans to make their cannon. They derived the name "Skipper" from the fact that President John Kennedy, who had just been assassinated, had been the skipper of a PT-boat, and they wanted to do something to honor him.On its first firing at the next game with VMI, the eager cadets tripled the charge, which blew the hats off half the VMI keydets and shook the glass in the press-box windows of Roanoke's Victory Stadium. They never heard the VMI chant again.Today, Skipper is fired outside Lane Stadium when the football team enters the field and when it scores.A tradition dating from 1934, the Virginia Tech Ring Dance symbolizes a hallmark in a Tech student's career. Upon entering the dance, each couple receives a pair of ribbons in the class colors. The lady wears her date's ring on her wrist with the darker colored ribbon, and the gentleman wears his date's ring on his wrist with the lighter colored ribbon. At the official Ring Exchange, the Corps of Cadets enter the ballroom and stand in the shape of the Class numerals. As each couple exchanges rings, "Moonlight and VPI," written specifically for the Ring Dance by composer Fred Waring and lyricist Charles Gaynor, is sung. As the clock strikes midnight, the evening ends with an elaborate fireworks display on the Drillfield, and the playing of "Silvertaps."The Class of 1935 held the first Ring Dance on April 27, 1934, where the ring figure, sabre arch, and presentation of the ring by the Junior's date were introduced. Since then, the fame of the Ring Dance has spread across the nation, introducing many memorable highlights. Always, the Ring Dance is a night to remember for those receiving their rings."Night after night we "dragged" the rats and learned to flip our sabres correctly. ... Friday finally rolled around and brought our dates... as well as V. M. I.'s ambassadors of good will. The reception at the S. A. B. formally opened our debut and after three years of waiting... the figure - the ring - and the kiss." (from the 1942 Virginia Tech Yearbook)Unique to Tech is the word "coofer" that was coined in the early 1940s to refer to tests or homework completed in an earlier course that is available to students taking the course later, and used as a means of studying or preparing. The term originated at Bluefield College, a former extension branch of VPI, and is likely derived from the word "coffer" (synonym for a strongbox). A student from Bluefield College transferred to the Blacksburg campus and first introduced the term. It is often used as a verb in such constructions as "to coofer a problem," also sometimes spelled "koofer."The Class of 1911 was the first at Virginia Tech to have a class ring. However, the Class Ring Tradition truly began in 1912 when the Class of 1914 chose a student committee to design a class ring, which would be unique and meaningful to class members. Today, Virginia Tech is one of only a few colleges and universities that maintains a traditional class ring program. Two major traditions combine to make the Virginia Tech Ring Program unique: the design and the presentation of the rings.Virginia Tech introduces an entirely newly designed collection for each class. Each year, the Sophomore class selects a Ring Committee responsible for designing their class ring collection. Each collection includes certain elements: the screaming eagle, American flag, campus buildings and an interlocking chain around the bezel. The screaming eagle evolved from a pair of twin eagles used on the first Virginia Tech ring, symbolizing the twin virtues of strength and freedom. The American flag and campus buildings symbolize the enduring heritage of our nation and Virginia Tech. The chain represents "the strength of many united as one." Each Ring Committee adds unique designs reflecting their respective class experiences.Beginning in the 1990s, each class began naming their collection in honor of an outstanding Virginia Tech personality. During each class' junior year, at the annual Ring Premiere, the collection is unveiled and class members begin ordering their rings. The rings are not delivered until the week of Ring Dance, held in the spring of the class' junior year.A display case in the Williamsburg Room of Squires Student Center contains Virginia Tech class rings since 1921. The display was dedicated during the 1991 and 1986 class reunion in November of 1996. Other rings are on display in the Alumni Museum of the Holtzman Alumni Center.Written by Clara B. Cox (class of 1984), with input from Tom Tillar and Colonel Rock Roszak.Below are links to websites that offer information on the university's history.

However, when you consider additional benefits like free health care for full-time Soldiers, as well as allowances for housing and food, opportunities to get an advanced degree without incurring debt, 30 days paid leave every year, and more financial benefits, the Army is more competitive than similar civilian careers. Take a look at these pay tables to see current salaries.Yes, you can choose any college major you wish and still commission as an Officer through ROTC when you graduate.In college, Army ROTC classes normally involve one elective class and one lab per semester. Although the classes involve hands-on fieldwork as well as classroom work, they are standard college classes that fit into a normal academic schedule.No, you’ll receive this training as part of your ROTC coursework, so you do not have to attend Basic Combat Training as well.  After graduation, you will attend Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC), which will prepare you for your career as an Army Officer through classroom and field training.

                    Get local news delivered to your inbox!Reflecting national trends, total enrollment at Virginia’s public colleges and universities dropped this academic year in the first year-to-year decline since 1994.Virginia Tech, however, bucked the trend and slightly gained enrollment, passing Virginia Commonwealth University to become the second-largest public university in the state.Enrollment dipped at eight of the state’s 15 four-year institutions, including Virginia Commonwealth, which was once the largest public university and is now in the third spot.Total head count for public four-year schools fell 0.4 percent to 213,718 students from 214,667 in fall 2013, according to a report by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.George Mason University, which remains in the top spot with 33,791 students, also saw a slight enrollment drop of 126 students. But Virginia Tech edged VCU for the No. 2 spot as its enrollment climbed to 31,224 from 31,205.Enrollment at VCU slipped to 31,163 from 31,288. A rise in the number of undergraduates did not offset a drop of about 440 graduate students.However, 31 private, nonprofit schools in Virginia saw enrollment gains, rising to 135,591 from 131,910. Private enrollment is higher than it has ever been, even with the closure of Virginia Intermont College, SCHEV reports.Liberty University provided “the lion’s share of the enrollment at 81,459 students representing approximately 61 percent of private college enrollment in Virginia,” according to the report by Tod Massa, SCHEV’s director of policy research and data warehousing.The enrollment figures count all students enrolled for academic credit, including those studying online and part time.The staff report will be presented Monday to the State Council, which in October received a preview of the fall head count numbers that showed total public enrollment, including two-year colleges, dipped below 400,000 this fall for the first time since 2008.Although Monday’s report does not include two-year programs, SCHEV numbers show a steep overall drop in public enrollment. Including four-year and two-year programs, enrollment fell from 405,195 students in 2013 to 369,784 this fall.SCHEV Director Peter Blake, noting that community college enrollment boomed during the recession, said the dip is cyclical.“As the economy improves, you go get a job,” he said.According to the SCHEV report, the enrollment drop at the eight public schools was offset by gains of 1,287 students at the remaining seven, resulting in a net loss of 949 students.While some states have reported notable enrollment declines resulting from a “significant softening of higher education enrollment demand,” the SCHEV report says, enrollment at Virginia public four-year institutions “seems merely to have leveled off.”Although undergraduate enrollment was up slightly in Virginia, graduate numbers have declined steadily at public schools since a record high in 2009-10, the report says.Also decreasing is the separate category of first professional enrollment, which includes degree programs for legal and health-related careers. The report attributes the decline to “the lowest level of enrollment in Virginia’s law schools at public institutions in the past 23 years.”Current enrollment of 2,113 is the result of annual decreases since an all-time high of 2,583 in 2007-08 at public law schools. The previous lowest enrollment of 2,277 was in 2000-01, the report says.Private schools surpassed public institutions in the number of graduate students and first professionals.Collectively the private schools enrolled 39,954 graduate students and 7,438 first professionals, compared with 39,669 and 4,930, respectively, in public programs.Again, the short answer for that is Liberty, Massa said by email. “Liberty accounts for 28,710 graduate students, or 72 percent of the private total, and 3,005 first professional students, or 40 percent of the private total.”Liberty’s overall enrollment growth “over the past decade is phenomenal,” he said. “Many of these students are distance students from all over the country, if not the world.”Besides VCU and GMU, the other public schools with enrollment drops were Christopher Newport, Norfolk State, Radford University, the University of Mary Washington, University of Virginia’s College at Wise and Virginia State University.NSU and VSU, both historically black universities, saw the largest drops at 10.4 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively, which the schools have blamed on changes in federal student loan requirements that prohibited many students from returning to school this fall.Get local news delivered to your inbox!Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device.Reflecting national trends, total enrollment at Virginia’s public colleges and universities dropped this academic year in the first year-to-year decline since 1994.Virginia Tech, however, bucked the trend and slightly gained enrollment, passing Virginia Commonwealth University to become the second-largest public university in the state.Enrollment dipped at eight of the state’s 15 four-year institutions, including Virginia Commonwealth, which was once the largest public university and is now in the third spot.Total head count for public four-year schools fell 0.4 percent to 213,718 students from 214,667 in fall 2013, according to a report by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.George Mason University, which remains in the top spot with 33,791 students, also saw a slight enrollment drop of 126 students. But Virginia Tech edged VCU for the No. 2 spot as its enrollment climbed to 31,224 from 31,205.Enrollment at VCU slipped to 31,163 from 31,288.

 Mission of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation (ASF):

To aid the United States in retaining its world leadership in technology and innovation by supporting the very best and brightest scholars in science, technology, engineering and mathematics while commemorating the legacy of America’s pioneering astronauts.Virginia Tech is proud to be a participating university in the Astronaut Scholarship.A nominee for the Astronaut Scholarship must be a citizen of the United States, either native born or naturalized, and must be at least a sophomore applying for their junior, or a junior applying to receive a scholarship for their senior year. Additionally, nominated students must be enrolled for both semesters as a full-time student for the ASF-supported academic year. Applicants must be seeking a STEM degree with intentions to pursue research or advance their field upon completion of their final degrees. Students intending to pursue a practice in professional medicine are not eligible for the scholarship. However, those intending to perform biomedical research are eligible.Note: Special consideration is NOT given to aeronautical/astronautical engineering students or those intending to pursue careers as astronauts.November    January         February        March           June               Last year ASF awarded 52 scholarships to students from 38 different universities across the nation. Astronaut Scholarships are awarded to students in their junior and senior year of college studying science, technology, engineering, or mathematics with the intent to pursue research or advance their field upon completion of their final degree. Astronaut Scholars are among the best and brightest minds in STEM who show initiative, creativity, and excellence in their chosen field.The Astronaut Scholarship Foundation awarded its first seven scholarships in 1986. Each founding Mercury 7 astronaut sponsored a $1,000 scholarship and they then began to fundraise to support future scholarships. Each astronaut would donate proceeds from their speaking engagements and shared the ASF mission wherever they went to raise awareness of both the mission and the scholarship program.

Today, the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation awards fifty scholarships valued up to $10,000 to each selected scholar. The ASF scholarship award is just the beginning for our Astronaut Scholars, and their selection is the beginning of a life-long relationship with astronauts, alumni, and great leaders who span academia, technical research, and corporate leadership.Past Virginia Tech Astronaut Scholars:2017    Arianna Krinos2018    Arianna Krinos2019    Jim Owens2020   Christine FaunceVirginia Tech Contact for the Astronaut Scholarship:

Additionally, nominated students must be enrolled for both semesters as a full-time student for the ASF-supported academic year. Applicants must be seeking a STEM degree with intentions to pursue research or advance their field upon completion of their final degrees. Students intending to pursue a practice in professional medicine are not eligible for the scholarship. However, those intending to perform biomedical research are eligible.Note: Special consideration is NOT given to aeronautical/astronautical engineering students or those intending to pursue careers as astronauts.November    January         February        March           June               Last year ASF awarded 52 scholarships to students from 38 different universities across the nation. Astronaut Scholarships are awarded to students in their junior and senior year of college studying science, technology, engineering, or mathematics with the intent to pursue research or advance their field upon completion of their final degree. Astronaut Scholars are among the best and brightest minds in STEM who show initiative, creativity, and excellence in their chosen field.The Astronaut Scholarship Foundation awarded its first seven scholarships in 1986. Each founding Mercury 7 astronaut sponsored a $1,000 scholarship and they then began to fundraise to support future scholarships. Each astronaut would donate proceeds from their speaking engagements and shared the ASF mission wherever they went to raise awareness of both the mission and the scholarship program.

Today, the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation awards fifty scholarships valued up to $10,000 to each selected scholar. The ASF scholarship award is just the beginning for our Astronaut Scholars, and their selection is the beginning of a life-long relationship with astronauts, alumni, and great leaders who span academia, technical research, and corporate leadership.Past Virginia Tech Astronaut Scholars:2017    Arianna Krinos2018    Arianna Krinos2019    Jim Owens2020   Christine FaunceVirginia Tech Contact for the Astronaut Scholarship:

Among those few are eight Virginia Tech alumni. The number is particularly significant considering that a little more than half of the nation's medals were awarded during the Civil War, before Virginia Tech's founding. The eight names are etched in a marble cenotaph, a symbolic tomb, at the center the court above War Memorial ChapelAntoine Gaujot, Class of 1900, and Julien Gaujot, Class of 1893, are two of the few brothers to earn the Medal of Honor and the only pair to receive the medal for actions in different wars.Antoine Gaujot received the medal for actions as an Army corporal at the Battle of San Mateo in 1899 during the Philippine Insurrection. He made persistent effort under heavy enemy rifle fire to locate a ford to help his unit cross the swollen river to attack. Unable to accomplish this, he swam with a companion again under fire and against a dangerous current across the river to the enemy side. There he secured an enemy canoe and returned it to the friendly side of the river.Julien Gaujot, an Army captain, received the medal for actions on the Mexican Border in 1911. He is the only soldier awarded the medal for peacekeeping actions. In Douglas, Ariz., stray bullets from fighting among Mexican rebels and government troops caused American casualties. Gaujot crossed the border and moved between the two groups of belligerents for an hour under heavy fire. This secured the safe passage of the Mexican soldiers and American prisoners over the border to the United States. His actions saved five Americans taken prisoner by the Mexicans, 25 Mexican soldiers, plus Americans and Mexican rebels who would have died in continued fighting.Earle Gregory, Class of 1923, received the Medal of Honor for actions as an Army sergeant during the Meuse Argonne Offensive along the Western Front in World War I. He is considered the first Virginia veteran from World War I to receive the medal and often was called the “Sergeant York of Virginia.” Armed with a rifle and a mortar shell used as a hand grenade, Gregory single-handedly captured a machine gun and three enemy soldiers. Continuing his advance he captured a howitzer and 19 enemy soldiers.Herbert Thomas, Class of 1941, received the Medal of Honor for action on Bougainville Island in the South Pacific in World War II while a Marine Corps sergeant. Through dense jungle and severe machine gun fire, Thomas led his men in destroying two enemy machine gun positions. Halted by a third enemy machine gun, he positioned his men to rush the enemy after he threw a hand grenade. He threw the grenade only to have the jungle vines drop it back among his men. Seeing the danger to his men, he jumped on the grenade, saving their lives with the sacrifice of his own. Thomas Hall is named in his honor.Jimmie Waters Monteith Jr.Jimmie Monteith, Class of 1941, received the Medal of Honor for actions as an Army lieutenant at D-Day during World War II. Without regard for his own safety, he led the assault over exposed beach to the cover a narrow ledge. Leaving cover, he moved toward two tanks. Exposed to intense artillery and machine gun fire, he led them through a minefield and directed the tank fire, destroying several enemy positions. He then returned to his men and led them in the capture of an advantageous position. Against vicious enemy counterattacks he repetitively crossed open terrain under heavy fire to strengthen his unit's defense until he was killed. Monteith Hall was named in his honor.Robert Femoyer, Class of 1944, enlisted in the Army Air Force during World War II and is the only navigator awarded the Medal of Honor. On a bombing mission over Germany, he was wounded by enemy aircraft fire, which seriously damaged his B-17 bomber. Despite extreme pain and great loss of blood, he refused morphine to keep his mental faculties clear. For 2½ hours he guided the lone bomber through six changes in course around enemy anti-aircraft concentrations. As the crippled aircraft crossed safely over the English Channel, Femoyer finally allowed an injection of morphine. Thirty minutes after landing he died of wounds. Femoyer Hall is named in his honor.Richard Shea, Class of 1948, received the Medal of Honor for actions as an Army first lieutenant at Pork Chop Hill during the Korean War. Fighting outnumbered, he voluntarily proceeded to the area most threatened to organize and lead a counterattack. During the bitter fighting, he killed two enemy soldiers with his trench knife. In more than 18 hours of heavy fighting, he moved among the defenders of Pork Chop Hill to ensure a successful defense. Leading a counterattack, he killed three enemy soldiers single-handedly. Although wounded, he refused evacuation. He was last seen fighting hand-to-hand during yet another counterattack.A unit commander in the U.S. Army, 1st Lt. Gary Lee Miller, Class of 1969, died from wounds he received while serving with the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, in action in Binh Duong Province, Vietnam.Miller was serving as a platoon leader at night when his company ambushed a hostile force infiltrating from Cambodian sanctuaries. After contact was broken, Miller led a reconnaissance patrol to search the area for enemy casualties. As the group advanced, it was attacked and Miller seriously wounded. During the fight, an enemy grenade was thrown into the midst of Miller's group. Miller threw himself on it, absorbing the force of the explosion with his body. His action saved nearby members of his patrol.A resident of Covington, Virginia, Miller attended Clifton Forge-Covington Community College during a period when it was designated a branch of Virginia Tech.Get Directions  See All Locations  Contact Virginia Tech  © 2023 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Without regard for his own safety, he led the assault over exposed beach to the cover a narrow ledge. Leaving cover, he moved toward two tanks. Exposed to intense artillery and machine gun fire, he led them through a minefield and directed the tank fire, destroying several enemy positions. He then returned to his men and led them in the capture of an advantageous position. Against vicious enemy counterattacks he repetitively crossed open terrain under heavy fire to strengthen his unit's defense until he was killed. Monteith Hall was named in his honor.Robert Femoyer, Class of 1944, enlisted in the Army Air Force during World War II and is the only navigator awarded the Medal of Honor. On a bombing mission over Germany, he was wounded by enemy aircraft fire, which seriously damaged his B-17 bomber. Despite extreme pain and great loss of blood, he refused morphine to keep his mental faculties clear. For 2½ hours he guided the lone bomber through six changes in course around enemy anti-aircraft concentrations. As the crippled aircraft crossed safely over the English Channel, Femoyer finally allowed an injection of morphine. Thirty minutes after landing he died of wounds. Femoyer Hall is named in his honor.Richard Shea, Class of 1948, received the Medal of Honor for actions as an Army first lieutenant at Pork Chop Hill during the Korean War. Fighting outnumbered, he voluntarily proceeded to the area most threatened to organize and lead a counterattack. During the bitter fighting, he killed two enemy soldiers with his trench knife. In more than 18 hours of heavy fighting, he moved among the defenders of Pork Chop Hill to ensure a successful defense. Leading a counterattack, he killed three enemy soldiers single-handedly. Although wounded, he refused evacuation. He was last seen fighting hand-to-hand during yet another counterattack.A unit commander in the U.S. Army, 1st Lt. Gary Lee Miller, Class of 1969, died from wounds he received while serving with the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, in action in Binh Duong Province, Vietnam.Miller was serving as a platoon leader at night when his company ambushed a hostile force infiltrating from Cambodian sanctuaries. After contact was broken, Miller led a reconnaissance patrol to search the area for enemy casualties. As the group advanced, it was attacked and Miller seriously wounded. During the fight, an enemy grenade was thrown into the midst of Miller's group. Miller threw himself on it, absorbing the force of the explosion with his body. His action saved nearby members of his patrol.A resident of Covington, Virginia, Miller attended Clifton Forge-Covington Community College during a period when it was designated a branch of Virginia Tech.Get Directions  See All Locations  Contact Virginia Tech  © 2021 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College.  The location of the college at Blacksburg was the result of several years of
legislative debate, dubbed the 'War of the Colleges' by the press.

Claims for the money were made by some twenty-four different schools in the state.  Many different proposals were also made
as to the disposition of the fund.  One proposal was that the money be given to a new school or to one that would give up its
charter and become the Agricultural and Mechanical College.  Another proposal was to divide the money between whites and
blacks and establish a new school for blacks.

At the time, the Preston and Olin Institute at Blacksburg was in financial difficulty and its trustees decided to ask the
legislature for the fund.  It did so by means of a letter to Senator John E. Penn who represented the Blacksburg District.
Penn was willing to support the request, and apparently at his suggestion the trustees of the Preston and Olin Institute
promised to permit the reorganization of the school into an agricultural and mechanical college in return for the land-grant
money.  At the same time the people of Montgomery County pledge $20,000 to the new school if established.

In the State Senate, Penn secured the whole hearted support of Gabriel C. Wharton in the House of Delegates, and these two
after a long and often bitter and acrimonious struggle succeeded in getting a bill passed which provided that one third of the
land-grant fund be donated to the Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute for the blacks, and two thirds to be donated to the
Preston and Olin Institute, if the latter institute relinquished its charter, donated its property to the state and reorganized as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College.  Governor Walker signed the bill on March 19, 1872.

The Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was thereby born.

But for a long walk from Sinking Creek in Craig County to Blacksburg on
October 1, 1872, William Addison Caldwell may never have attained his
singular position in the history of Virginia Tech.

His trek over mountains and through valleys on that particular autumn
day, however, ended in the Preston and Olin Building, where 16-year-old
"Add" became the first student to register at the Virginia Agricultural
and Mechanical College (V.A.M.C.), the commonwealth's new land-grant
institution that eventually became Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University.

Born on January 10, 1856--probably in his parents' home--at Sinking
Creek in Craig County, Va., Add Caldwell was the second of George
Charlton and Lorena Givens Caldwell's nine children.  Generation after
generation of Caldwells had lived in Craig's valleys since the 1760's,
when King George III of England granted land to their forebear, John
Caldwell.  The land, rolling hills bordered by mountains, was once part
of Botetourt County, but that section of Botetourt and sections of
Roanoke, Giles, and Monroe counties, were joined in 1851 to create the
new county of Craig.

Add's father--like his grandfather, Archibald Caldwell--was a farmer who
owned many acres of land.  George's large, two-story frame house, where
his children probably were born, still sits above the base of a
mountain, providing a panoramic view of the valley farmland that he
owned.

Growing up on a farm, Add surely had chores assigned to him, and his
father, a veteran of the Civil War who had owned a slave around 1860,
would also have encouraged or made arrangements for his schooling. 
According to an article written by J.C. Martin for the New Castle Record
and reprinted in the book Bits and Pieces of Craig County Schools, "The
Confederate [soldier] who had been deprived by the war of such
educational advantages as his time afforded was very anxious that his
children . . . might have a better opportunity than he had."  The method
of educating young Add and his school-age siblings, however, can only be
surmised since the county's school records were destroyed by fire.  But
Craig County historian Jane Johnston says he most likely attended a one-
or two-room school since several existed near the family farm.  Or, she
adds, he may have been taught by an instructor hired to come into the
home, another method of education popular in the county among more
prosperous residents.  His last year or two as a Craig County student
may have been spent in a public school since that system of education
was introduced in 1870.

What prompted Add Caldwell to investigate the agricultural and
mechanical school in Blacksburg may never be known.  Whether he saw one
of many advertisements the school's president, Charles L.C. Minor,
placed in newspapers throughout the state or learned of the new school
through word of mouth, Add and his older brother, 18-year-old Milton M.
"Mic" Caldwell, left their home in Sinking Creek community and walked as
much as 28 miles to Blacksburg.  Johnston says the boys would have known
about foot trails across the mountains, which could have shortened their
walk considerably.  Mic's daughter, Katherine Caldwell Mendez, now 90
years old, remembers her father telling her that he walked to the school
with his brother.

Virginia Tech historian D.L. Kinnear, in his book The First 100 Years,
describes what happened that day in the Preston and Olin Building:

While Add has been targeted as the first student to register, Mic also
registered, probably the same day.  Other students trickled in,
prompting President Minor to write during that first month to Gen.
Joseph R. Anderson, a member of the school's Board of Visitors: "We have
now thirty students matriculated, and there are, I think a dozen more,
of the vicinity, holding back in hope of some abatement of accommodation
in the way of delay such as they have been used to received [sic] from
the Preston and Olin Institute.  We are in correspondence with a good
many others, but [it is] plain that our beginning is to be smaller than
had been expected by most of those who were best informed in the
matter."

Calling the students "plain lads for the most part," President Minor
noted in the letter that he was "embarrassed by the fact that the wants
of the students who have come to us have forced us to vary materially
from the strictly technical training enjoined by the organization
Committee's report."  Later, in his report on the college to the state,
he said that many of the students came with "the scantiest preparation,"
which made it necessary for V.A.M.C. to "include much of the work
properly belonging to the high schools, or even the grammar schools,
thus leaving it impossible to do all that is to be desired in the
special technical courses."

By mid-November, newspapers reported that 60 students had registered and
"the tide of entrance is steadily flowing on to as full numbers as can
be comfortably accommodated." Total enrollment during the first year of
operation eventually reached 132.

Since Add was the first to register, he probably was among the students
who lived in the Preston and Olin Building, described in an 1872 report
to the Commissioner of Agriculture as "a substantial three-story brick
edifice, 100 feet by 40, containing three recitation rooms, a chapel,
and twenty-four lodging rooms."  Those students who could not get
lodging on campus found rooms in town.  Since the college had no
facilities for providing meals, all students ate in town, many at
Luster's Hotel.  In 1873, a new building specifically built to serve
meals was completed, and students then had the option--until 1881--to
eat on campus or in town.

Each year that Add was enrolled, at least one of his brothers was
enrolled as well.  Mic, who never graduated, was on the rolls in 1872
and 1873 and again during 1876 and 1877. Another brother, Frank B.
Caldwell, about two years younger than Add, enrolled during Add's third
year and attended three consecutive terms but, like Mic, did not
graduate.

Add's scholarship, reportedly given him by a faculty and administration
ecstatic over finally getting a student, covered his tuition of $30, his
college fees of $10, and, if he roomed in the Preston and Olin Building,
his $5 per month room rent (unfurnished). "Table board" could be had for
$12 per month, and coal reportedly was "convenient and cheap."  Students
were required to deposit $5 with the treasurer as a contingent fee to
cover damages to property.  Uniforms cost an additional $17.25.

Like all students enrolled in first year studies, Add would have been
exposed to commercial arithmetic, bookkeeping, algebra, English grammar,
geography with map drawing, descriptive astronomy, penmanship, free-hand
drawing, lectures on physiology and hygiene, lectures on habits and
manners, lectures on the value of agricultural and mechanical arts to
society, French or German, farm or shop practice, and military tactics.

According to the 1964 VPI Historical Data Book, compiled and edited by
Jenkins Mikell Robertson, the entire college was under military
discipline from the beginning.  Students were "required to meet
formations, march to classes, pass room inspections, have military
passes when off campus, and conform to other types of military
behavior."  The students were assigned to one of two companies, A or B,
and each wore a standard uniform--a cap, jacket, and pants of cadet
gray, trimmed with black.  Add, a member of Company B, attained the rank
of second sergeant by the middle of his final year in college.

Each Memorial Day, the corps marched to Montgomery White Sulphur
Springs, 12-15 miles away, to honor the Confederate soldiers buried
there, returning to campus the same day.  In 1875, parts of the two
companies formed one company for the long march, while the remaining
students rode to the ceremony, prompting a comment from a Gen. Preston
that "it was 'd_____ poor militia that had to be hauled about in
ambulances."

Students also participated in a literary society that they organized
during the college's inaugural year.  The one society was succeeded by
two societies that became, in 1873, the Lee Literary Society and the
Maury Literary Society.  These societies, which focused on public
speaking, debate, and creative writing, started the first student
publication, The Gray Jacket, in 1875.

Add, a member of the Maury Literary Society, served on a joint committee
representing both societies.  The committee, according to an 1876 issue
of The Gray Jacket, concurred with the societies of Washington and
Graham-Lee in having an Inter-collegiate Association of Virginia
convention at Lynchburg.

The first school year at V.A.M.C. ran from October 1, 1872, to the last
Wednesday in July, 1873.  During the second year and for nine years
following, summer vacation was replaced with a vacation that began
around Christmas and lasted until late February. President Minor, in an
1875 issue of The Gray Jacket, justified the new school term, saying the
winter vacation was "best suited for an institution of this character"
because "the study of farm operations is interrupted at a less important
season of the year, besides students from other sections of the country,
while escaping the severity of winter in the mountains, will remain at
College during the most pleasant and healthful part of the year."

Add's performance in his classes is only partially known.  His obituary
says he graduated "at the head of his class," but it is likely that the
reporter confused his status as the college's first student, especially
since

Add's 1875 report card, mailed to his father in Craig County and donated
to Virginia Tech in 1992 by Frank Caldwell, lists his grades as follows:

Intermediate Year
Mathematics - 5
Chemistry - 7
The university archives includes a copy of the 1875 chemistry exam that Add would have taken.
Natural History - 8
Composition and Rhetoric - 7.5
French - 8
Composition (written) - 10
Military Tactics - 9.5
Farm work - 10

Senior Year
Book-Keeping - 5

William Addison Caldwell graduated from V.A.M.C. with the college's
second graduating class in the 1876 commencement exercises, which began
on August 6 with a sermon by the Rev. Oscar F. Flippo of Baltimore.  Two
days later, he listened to the fourth annual address before the literary
societies, delivered by Maj. John W. Daniel of Lynchburg. Virginia's
Governor Kemper, who was in attendance was "loudly called for" and
"responded in a brief but able and eloquent speech."  At 5 p.m. the same
day, the corps was reviewed by the governor and the college's Board of
Visitors.  On August 9, President Minor presented the diplomas--students
at that time received graduate certificates rather than degrees--and
Gen. J.H. Williams of Winchester delivered the annual address to faculty
and students.

The morning of August 9, the graduating class held an alumni meeting in
the Lee Society hall.  Following remarks by President Minor and a J.
Lawrence Radford "of Montgomery," the alumni association elected
officers for the ensuing year, including Add as secretary.

Following graduation, Add may have returned to Craig County to teach
school.  In 1877, an editor of The Gray Jacket complained that "so few
of our 'Old Boys' are farmers" and that "so many of them became
teachers."  But, the editor continued, "We must remember that these
gentlemen are, as far as we are informed, teaching public schools in
their immediate neighborhoods, and that the session of these schools, in
most cases, holds only through a part of the fall, winter, and spring
months, leaving cropping months entirely out. Now from what we can learn
of the matter our 'Old Boys' are farming in summer and teaching in
winter; thus they are most aptly filling their places as good citizens
and grateful sons of Virginia."  Certainly by 1880 Add, Mic, and Frank
were living with their parents in Sinking Creek, and all three were
teaching school.  At that time, Craig County employed 26 teachers for
its 26 public schools.

How long or where Add taught cannot be ascertained, but by 1887 he was
living in Roanoke, possibly with his youngest brother, E. Gambill "Gam"
Caldwell, and working in the general office of Norfolk and Western and
attending First Presbyterian Church.  Since Gam and Frank, who had
attended V.A.M.C. with Add, both worked at one time for Norfolk and
Western, the possibility exists that the three worked there together.

Before Add moved to Wilmington, N.C., around 1898--he moved his church
membership there in March of 1902--he became interested in the real
estate business in Roanoke, but whether he derived an income from the
sale of property is not known.  His work at the railroad office later
prompted a description of him as "a well known and popular employee."

In Wilmington, Add worked for several large wholesale firms on the
wharf:  the Stove Company, Mr. W.B. Cooper, Messrs. Blair & Haly, and
the C.C. Covington Company, traveling part of the time out of
Wilmington.  Perhaps one of these companies sold molasses since the
Virginia Tech Alumni Association reported in 1911 that Add had been a
salesman for a molasses firm.

After Add left the homeplace in Craig County, his brother Mic moved to
Radford and later persuaded his parents to sell the family farm in
Sinking Creek and move to Radford as well.  Two sisters, Grace and
Nell--like their brother Add, the two never married--moved with their
parents to a house across the street from Mic.  During summer vacations,
Add visited his relatives in Radford.

Sometime before 1910, Add's health declined, and Mrs. Mendez says he
underwent surgery for a brain tumor.  He recuperated from the operation
at his mother's home--his father had died around 1904.  According to
Mrs. Mendez, the doctor told Add that salt air would be good for him, so
he secured a position as a clerk at the Tangmoore (or Tarrymoore) Hotel
at Wrightsville Beach near Wilmington in the spring of 1910.  The job,
which he probably started around the first of June, was to last until
September 1.

On June 15, 1910, Add wrote his niece, who had developed a fond
attachment for this uncle who would play games with her and help her
with such chores as capping strawberries.  In the letter, which included
several pictures of the beach, Add admitted that the hotel was "a fine
place to spend the summer" but said he would rather be in Radford.

"I have not been here long enough to tell whether the salt air is going
to benefit me or not," he continued.  "I am feeling about the same, no
worse, no better."

He closed the letter by asking Mrs. Mendez, who was then nine years old,
to "[r]emember me to your grandmother [his mother] and with much love to
all of you and especially to yourself, I am fondly yours, Add."

A few days after he wrote the letter, Add fainted, sustaining a severe
fall that apparently resulted in a head injury.  Taken to the hospital
in Wilmington, he died ten days later on June 29, 1910.  His body was
taken to Radford, and his funeral was held in his mother's home.  His
old paster from First Presbyterian Church in Roanoke, Dr. W.C. Campbell,
conducted the service with assistance from three other pastors.  On July
1, Add was buried in the Caldwell family cemetery in Radford.

Today, the memory of William Addison Caldwell lives on--in the undying
affection of his niece, who donated the letter he wrote her to Virginia
Tech; through a nephew and namesake in Radford, who presented the
university with his uncle's bible in 1989; and in his singular role in
the slow and sometimes tumultuous birthing process of the school that
was to become Virginia Tech.

    voted to recommend to President Hahn that he remove the Confederate flag
    from the Coliseum and, at the same time, refused to censor the VPI
    regimental Band from playing "Dixie". Approximately 25 interested students
    attended the meeting and many of these expressed their views on the issue.
    Dwight Crewe, president of the Human Relations Council, said in presenting
    the issues to the committee that the university should not
    "institutionalize" racism by flying the flag in the coliseum. Crewe said he
    felt the matter was not a question of majority rule but rather, of the
    rights of the individual.Mark Musick, president of the Class of '69 and SGA senator, doubted
    this. Musick said that since neither side was totally right or totally
    wrong, then it was questionable as to whether the wishes of individuals
    should prevail over the wishes of the majority. Musick asked Crewe what he
    or others who felt the same way had done to "educate" the majority into
    believing as the minority does. Musick suggested that the use of the campus
    publications and dorm "bull" sessions as a means of doing this.Crewe replied that he would be wasting his time trying to do this. In
    presenting the question to the student body, Crewe felt that he would come
    across 75% apathy and the other 25% would not change their minds.Ray Smoot, SGA president, said that the majority of the students viewed
    the flag as a symbol of school spirit and not a symbol of racism. Crewe
    rebutted this by saying that there was no way that black students could
    rally around this school spirit symbol. Crewe said that one of the major
    reasons black athletes and students don't come to Tech is because of the
    flag in the Coliseum.Mike Guy, president of the CIC, made a motion that was amended to read
    as follows: "The Student Activities Committee recommends that the
    University should not fly the Confederate battle flag in the Coliseum or at
    any other location on campus as an official policy of the University."Before this motion was voted on, Ray Smoot moved to refer the matter "to
    the SGA Senate for consideration before the Student Activities Committee
    acts on the original motion." The referral motion was defeated by the vote
    of Chairman James Dean after the committee itself deadlocked at 9 - 9 vote.
    The original motion then was passed with smoot casting the only dissenting
    vote.The SAC then took up the matter of "Dixie." Steve Wickham, captain of
    the Regimental Band, said that the members of the band view "Dixie" as a
    fight song, and not one of racism. He stated that if the student body were
    against it, then the band could not play it. He added that the band would
    view it as a form of censorship if they were told not to play it.Al Savageau, chairman of the Publications Board, agreed with Wickham. He
    felt that the matter of the "Dixie" was totally different from the flag
    issue since censorship of the band might lead to censorship of student
    publications.Pat Tucker, president of the SGA Senate, made the following motion which
    was approved by the committee, "The Student Act Committee recommends that
    the University should not censor any recognized student organization
    operating within its charter as approved by the SAC, for any of its actions
    except those outside state and federal laws. We further believe that
    limiting the selection of music available to the VPI Regimental Band is
    censorship for reasons other than state and federal laws."Mark Musick then read the following motion: "The Student Activities
    Committee recommends to the president of the University Council be asked
    for recommendation concerning the question: Should the University fly the
    Confederate battle flag in the Coliseum or at any location on campus as a
    part of University authority. The SAC has recommended that the flag,
    commonly referred to as the Confederate battle flag, should not be flown on
    campus as part of University authority. However, it does not recommend that
    the flag be removed until all other appropriate groups in the University
    community have been consulted." The motion was then approved by the
    committee.The University Archives collects, preserves, and provides access to materials documenting the history and development of the university and its various components.Example materials in the University Archives include

The Dream
The famous game cannon of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets was born in the dreams of three cadets of the class of 1964 and it's metal tested in the heat of battle between VPI and VMI.

For a third year, two close friends in the Corps "Butch" Harper aka Alton B. Harper Jr. and "Sonny" Hickam aka Homer Hadley Hickam sat in the stands of Victory Stadium in Roanoke in anticipation of the Thanksgiving Game with VMI.  The Tech Corps formed on the field first and took position while the VMI Corps marched into the stadium.

Both Corps of Cadets took their traditional positions on opposing sides.  And for the third time that Butch and Sonny had witnessed VMI brought in it's game cannon "Little John."  

Oh, it was a small thing that looked more like a mortar than a cannon.  They loaded it, fired it and the whole VMI Corps swelled with the chant, "Where's your cannon!," as a perfect smoke ring rose towards the sky.

This was too much to bear! Butch looked at Sonny and Sonny looked at Butch and the two made a solemn pact right there in the stands.  This would be the last time that VMI would be allowed to "out cannon" Virginia Tech.  They vowed to build the largest game cannon in the world.  We won the game.

The whole thing took on the form of a major military operation.  Sonny found the blueprints for a Civil War cannon barrel and Ben looked to find out where they could get a carriage made for the cannon.  But the proverbial problem soon became evident.  Where on earth would they get the money.

They attacked it on two sides.  First, they decided that it would have to come from the Corps itself with some help from Alumni.  Now just how do you convince 1700 folks to give money.

Sonny came up with the idea to have a wooden mold made of the barrel at our college of mechanical engineering.  They took it on as a class project.  

While they were working on the mold, Ben marched into the Commandant of Cadets, General Scheve's Office.  He sat behind an imposing walnut desk in his office in the Old Military Building.

After a proper salute was proffered, Ben noticed two crossed barrels on his uniform signifying his affiliation with artillery.  Suddenly the daunting task that was about to be requested seemed somehow possible.

With a slightly wavering voice Ben requested permission to speak.  "Sir, a request, Sir!"

"What is it young man," snapped General Scheve.  "Sir, I would like you to place me on the Regimental Staff next year so I can help build the largest game cannon in the world for the Corps."

Now at this particular moment, the General's stern countenance took on the warm glow of a grandfather seeing his first grandchild.  He tried terribly to look serious, but I knew he was just busting to hear the plan.

Well you see Sir.  Sonny Hickam and I, well I mean the whole Corps is getting tired of hearing it from VMI.  And we're getting damn tired of listening to that cannon with no response, sir.

Now if you could see fit to put me on as Regimental S-2, the Information Officer, I would have direct contact with the Alumni and we need their money and support.

"How big did you say it was going to be?" the General asked.  "The biggest damn cannon that VMI will ever see!" I snapped back.  "And you and Sonny can get it done?" he asked.

"Yes Sir!"

The General looked for a long time with no response.  I dare say, nobody had ever asked to be on the Regimental Staff before, it just was not done.  And I felt I had probably blown my whole military career.  But then, some things are worth it.  

"Noted," said the General.  "Dismissed!"

In the mean time, the cannon barrel project continued in the mechanical engineering shop.

I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
The famous game cannon of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets was born in the dreams of three cadets of the class of 1964 and it's metal tested in the heat of battle between VPI and VMI.

For a third year, two close friends in the Corps "Butch" Harper aka Alton B. Harper Jr. and "Sonny" Hickam aka Homer Hadley Hickam sat in the stands of Victory Stadium in Roanoke in anticipation of the Thanksgiving Game with VMI.  The Tech Corps formed on the field first and took position while the VMI Corps marched into the stadium.

Both Corps of Cadets took their traditional positions on opposing sides.  And for the third time that Butch and Sonny had witnessed VMI brought in it's game cannon "Little John."  

Oh, it was a small thing that looked more like a mortar than a cannon.  They loaded it, fired it and the whole VMI Corps swelled with the chant, "Where's your cannon!," as a perfect smoke ring rose towards the sky.

This was too much to bear! Butch looked at Sonny and Sonny looked at Butch and the two made a solemn pact right there in the stands.  This would be the last time that VMI would be allowed to "out cannon" Virginia Tech.  They vowed to build the largest game cannon in the world.  We won the game.

The whole thing took on the form of a major military operation.  Sonny found the blueprints for a Civil War cannon barrel and Ben looked to find out where they could get a carriage made for the cannon.  But the proverbial problem soon became evident.  Where on earth would they get the money.

They attacked it on two sides.  First, they decided that it would have to come from the Corps itself with some help from Alumni.  Now just how do you convince 1700 folks to give money.

Sonny came up with the idea to have a wooden mold made of the barrel at our college of mechanical engineering.  They took it on as a class project.  

While they were working on the mold, Ben marched into the Commandant of Cadets, General Scheve's Office.  He sat behind an imposing walnut desk in his office in the Old Military Building.

After a proper salute was proffered, Ben noticed two crossed barrels on his uniform signifying his affiliation with artillery.  Suddenly the daunting task that was about to be requested seemed somehow possible.

With a slightly wavering voice Ben requested permission to speak.  "Sir, a request, Sir!"

"What is it young man," snapped General Scheve.  "Sir, I would like you to place me on the Regimental Staff next year so I can help build the largest game cannon in the world for the Corps."

Now at this particular moment, the General's stern countenance took on the warm glow of a grandfather seeing his first grandchild.  He tried terribly to look serious, but I knew he was just busting to hear the plan.

Well you see Sir.  Sonny Hickam and I, well I mean the whole Corps is getting tired of hearing it from VMI.  And we're getting damn tired of listening to that cannon with no response, sir.

Now if you could see fit to put me on as Regimental S-2, the Information Officer, I would have direct contact with the Alumni and we need their money and support.

"How big did you say it was going to be?" the General asked.  "The biggest damn cannon that VMI will ever see!" I snapped back.  "And you and Sonny can get it done?" he asked.

"Yes Sir!"

The General looked for a long time with no response.  I dare say, nobody had ever asked to be on the Regimental Staff before, it just was not done.  And I felt I had probably blown my whole military career.  But then, some things are worth it.  

"Noted," said the General.  "Dismissed!"

In the mean time, the cannon barrel project continued in the mechanical engineering shop.

I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
Both Corps of Cadets took their traditional positions on opposing sides.  And for the third time that Butch and Sonny had witnessed VMI brought in it's game cannon "Little John."  

Oh, it was a small thing that looked more like a mortar than a cannon.  They loaded it, fired it and the whole VMI Corps swelled with the chant, "Where's your cannon!," as a perfect smoke ring rose towards the sky.

This was too much to bear! Butch looked at Sonny and Sonny looked at Butch and the two made a solemn pact right there in the stands.  This would be the last time that VMI would be allowed to "out cannon" Virginia Tech.  They vowed to build the largest game cannon in the world.  We won the game.

The whole thing took on the form of a major military operation.  Sonny found the blueprints for a Civil War cannon barrel and Ben looked to find out where they could get a carriage made for the cannon.  But the proverbial problem soon became evident.  Where on earth would they get the money.

They attacked it on two sides.  First, they decided that it would have to come from the Corps itself with some help from Alumni.  Now just how do you convince 1700 folks to give money.

Sonny came up with the idea to have a wooden mold made of the barrel at our college of mechanical engineering.  They took it on as a class project.  

While they were working on the mold, Ben marched into the Commandant of Cadets, General Scheve's Office.  He sat behind an imposing walnut desk in his office in the Old Military Building.

After a proper salute was proffered, Ben noticed two crossed barrels on his uniform signifying his affiliation with artillery.  Suddenly the daunting task that was about to be requested seemed somehow possible.

With a slightly wavering voice Ben requested permission to speak.  "Sir, a request, Sir!"

"What is it young man," snapped General Scheve.  "Sir, I would like you to place me on the Regimental Staff next year so I can help build the largest game cannon in the world for the Corps."

Now at this particular moment, the General's stern countenance took on the warm glow of a grandfather seeing his first grandchild.  He tried terribly to look serious, but I knew he was just busting to hear the plan.

Well you see Sir.  Sonny Hickam and I, well I mean the whole Corps is getting tired of hearing it from VMI.  And we're getting damn tired of listening to that cannon with no response, sir.

Now if you could see fit to put me on as Regimental S-2, the Information Officer, I would have direct contact with the Alumni and we need their money and support.

"How big did you say it was going to be?" the General asked.  "The biggest damn cannon that VMI will ever see!" I snapped back.  "And you and Sonny can get it done?" he asked.

"Yes Sir!"

The General looked for a long time with no response.  I dare say, nobody had ever asked to be on the Regimental Staff before, it just was not done.  And I felt I had probably blown my whole military career.  But then, some things are worth it.  

"Noted," said the General.  "Dismissed!"

In the mean time, the cannon barrel project continued in the mechanical engineering shop.

I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
This was too much to bear! Butch looked at Sonny and Sonny looked at Butch and the two made a solemn pact right there in the stands.  This would be the last time that VMI would be allowed to "out cannon" Virginia Tech.  They vowed to build the largest game cannon in the world.  We won the game.

The whole thing took on the form of a major military operation.  Sonny found the blueprints for a Civil War cannon barrel and Ben looked to find out where they could get a carriage made for the cannon.  But the proverbial problem soon became evident.  Where on earth would they get the money.

They attacked it on two sides.  First, they decided that it would have to come from the Corps itself with some help from Alumni.  Now just how do you convince 1700 folks to give money.

Sonny came up with the idea to have a wooden mold made of the barrel at our college of mechanical engineering.  They took it on as a class project.  

While they were working on the mold, Ben marched into the Commandant of Cadets, General Scheve's Office.  He sat behind an imposing walnut desk in his office in the Old Military Building.

After a proper salute was proffered, Ben noticed two crossed barrels on his uniform signifying his affiliation with artillery.  Suddenly the daunting task that was about to be requested seemed somehow possible.

With a slightly wavering voice Ben requested permission to speak.  "Sir, a request, Sir!"

"What is it young man," snapped General Scheve.  "Sir, I would like you to place me on the Regimental Staff next year so I can help build the largest game cannon in the world for the Corps."

Now at this particular moment, the General's stern countenance took on the warm glow of a grandfather seeing his first grandchild.  He tried terribly to look serious, but I knew he was just busting to hear the plan.

Well you see Sir.  Sonny Hickam and I, well I mean the whole Corps is getting tired of hearing it from VMI.  And we're getting damn tired of listening to that cannon with no response, sir.

Now if you could see fit to put me on as Regimental S-2, the Information Officer, I would have direct contact with the Alumni and we need their money and support.

"How big did you say it was going to be?" the General asked.  "The biggest damn cannon that VMI will ever see!" I snapped back.  "And you and Sonny can get it done?" he asked.

"Yes Sir!"

The General looked for a long time with no response.  I dare say, nobody had ever asked to be on the Regimental Staff before, it just was not done.  And I felt I had probably blown my whole military career.  But then, some things are worth it.  

"Noted," said the General.  "Dismissed!"

In the mean time, the cannon barrel project continued in the mechanical engineering shop.

I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
They attacked it on two sides.  First, they decided that it would have to come from the Corps itself with some help from Alumni.  Now just how do you convince 1700 folks to give money.

Sonny came up with the idea to have a wooden mold made of the barrel at our college of mechanical engineering.  They took it on as a class project.  

While they were working on the mold, Ben marched into the Commandant of Cadets, General Scheve's Office.  He sat behind an imposing walnut desk in his office in the Old Military Building.

After a proper salute was proffered, Ben noticed two crossed barrels on his uniform signifying his affiliation with artillery.  Suddenly the daunting task that was about to be requested seemed somehow possible.

With a slightly wavering voice Ben requested permission to speak.  "Sir, a request, Sir!"

"What is it young man," snapped General Scheve.  "Sir, I would like you to place me on the Regimental Staff next year so I can help build the largest game cannon in the world for the Corps."

Now at this particular moment, the General's stern countenance took on the warm glow of a grandfather seeing his first grandchild.  He tried terribly to look serious, but I knew he was just busting to hear the plan.

Well you see Sir.  Sonny Hickam and I, well I mean the whole Corps is getting tired of hearing it from VMI.  And we're getting damn tired of listening to that cannon with no response, sir.

Now if you could see fit to put me on as Regimental S-2, the Information Officer, I would have direct contact with the Alumni and we need their money and support.

"How big did you say it was going to be?" the General asked.  "The biggest damn cannon that VMI will ever see!" I snapped back.  "And you and Sonny can get it done?" he asked.

"Yes Sir!"

The General looked for a long time with no response.  I dare say, nobody had ever asked to be on the Regimental Staff before, it just was not done.  And I felt I had probably blown my whole military career.  But then, some things are worth it.  

"Noted," said the General.  "Dismissed!"

In the mean time, the cannon barrel project continued in the mechanical engineering shop.

I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
While they were working on the mold, Ben marched into the Commandant of Cadets, General Scheve's Office.  He sat behind an imposing walnut desk in his office in the Old Military Building.

After a proper salute was proffered, Ben noticed two crossed barrels on his uniform signifying his affiliation with artillery.  Suddenly the daunting task that was about to be requested seemed somehow possible.

With a slightly wavering voice Ben requested permission to speak.  "Sir, a request, Sir!"

"What is it young man," snapped General Scheve.  "Sir, I would like you to place me on the Regimental Staff next year so I can help build the largest game cannon in the world for the Corps."

Now at this particular moment, the General's stern countenance took on the warm glow of a grandfather seeing his first grandchild.  He tried terribly to look serious, but I knew he was just busting to hear the plan.

Well you see Sir.  Sonny Hickam and I, well I mean the whole Corps is getting tired of hearing it from VMI.  And we're getting damn tired of listening to that cannon with no response, sir.

Now if you could see fit to put me on as Regimental S-2, the Information Officer, I would have direct contact with the Alumni and we need their money and support.

"How big did you say it was going to be?" the General asked.  "The biggest damn cannon that VMI will ever see!" I snapped back.  "And you and Sonny can get it done?" he asked.

"Yes Sir!"

The General looked for a long time with no response.  I dare say, nobody had ever asked to be on the Regimental Staff before, it just was not done.  And I felt I had probably blown my whole military career.  But then, some things are worth it.  

"Noted," said the General.  "Dismissed!"

In the mean time, the cannon barrel project continued in the mechanical engineering shop.

I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
With a slightly wavering voice Ben requested permission to speak.  "Sir, a request, Sir!"

"What is it young man," snapped General Scheve.  "Sir, I would like you to place me on the Regimental Staff next year so I can help build the largest game cannon in the world for the Corps."

Now at this particular moment, the General's stern countenance took on the warm glow of a grandfather seeing his first grandchild.  He tried terribly to look serious, but I knew he was just busting to hear the plan.

Well you see Sir.  Sonny Hickam and I, well I mean the whole Corps is getting tired of hearing it from VMI.  And we're getting damn tired of listening to that cannon with no response, sir.

Now if you could see fit to put me on as Regimental S-2, the Information Officer, I would have direct contact with the Alumni and we need their money and support.

"How big did you say it was going to be?" the General asked.  "The biggest damn cannon that VMI will ever see!" I snapped back.  "And you and Sonny can get it done?" he asked.

"Yes Sir!"

The General looked for a long time with no response.  I dare say, nobody had ever asked to be on the Regimental Staff before, it just was not done.  And I felt I had probably blown my whole military career.  But then, some things are worth it.  

"Noted," said the General.  "Dismissed!"

In the mean time, the cannon barrel project continued in the mechanical engineering shop.

I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.

Now at this particular moment, the General's stern countenance took on the warm glow of a grandfather seeing his first grandchild.  He tried terribly to look serious, but I knew he was just busting to hear the plan.

Well you see Sir.  Sonny Hickam and I, well I mean the whole Corps is getting tired of hearing it from VMI.  And we're getting damn tired of listening to that cannon with no response, sir.

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
Well you see Sir.  Sonny Hickam and I, well I mean the whole Corps is getting tired of hearing it from VMI.  And we're getting damn tired of listening to that cannon with no response, sir.

Now if you could see fit to put me on as Regimental S-2, the Information Officer, I would have direct contact with the Alumni and we need their money and support.

"How big did you say it was going to be?" the General asked.  "The biggest damn cannon that VMI will ever see!" I snapped back.  "And you and Sonny can get it done?" he asked.

"Yes Sir!"

The General looked for a long time with no response.  I dare say, nobody had ever asked to be on the Regimental Staff before, it just was not done.  And I felt I had probably blown my whole military career.  But then, some things are worth it.  

"Noted," said the General.  "Dismissed!"

In the mean time, the cannon barrel project continued in the mechanical engineering shop.

I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
"How big did you say it was going to be?" the General asked.  "The biggest damn cannon that VMI will ever see!" I snapped back.  "And you and Sonny can get it done?" he asked.

"Yes Sir!"

The General looked for a long time with no response.  I dare say, nobody had ever asked to be on the Regimental Staff before, it just was not done.  And I felt I had probably blown my whole military career.  But then, some things are worth it.  

"Noted," said the General.  "Dismissed!"

In the mean time, the cannon barrel project continued in the mechanical engineering shop.

I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
The General looked for a long time with no response.  I dare say, nobody had ever asked to be on the Regimental Staff before, it just was not done.  And I felt I had probably blown my whole military career.  But then, some things are worth it.  

"Noted," said the General.  "Dismissed!"

In the mean time, the cannon barrel project continued in the mechanical engineering shop.

I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.

He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
I looked toward change of rank with great misgivings.  Had I blown it?  Was the General going to teach me a lesson for being so brash?  As all of us marched onto the drill field to find our new destiny, my knees felt weak.  I was certain that nothing would come of my request and that we may not be able to fulfill our dreams without the help of the Alumni.

The Seniors left their position of rank and the names of the Junior class drifted across the expanse of the drill field.  "A" Squadron was first.  Sonny was made an officer in "A" Squadron.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

I know it was what he wanted and I was happy for him.  No rank for me in A Squadron.

There I stood feeling very, very alone.  Without getting anything in the Squadron, that only left Group and Regimental Staff.  Group's Staff came and went.  No rank for me in Group.

Now I was sure that this upstart was doomed.  After what seemed like a century.  The assignments for Regimental were droned out.  I can't tell you what it meant when I heard "Regimental S-2, Cadet Alton B. Harper, Jr."  It meant that we could fulfill the dream.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

That the channel to the Alumni was open.

As we passed in final review and the New Regimental Staff saluted the Commandant of Cadets, I looked toward the General and witnessed the biggest smile I've ever seen. As he raised his hand in salute, it was the one and only time I have ever been given a wink by a General.  It was his way of saying, "Now go build that cannon for this old artillery man, son."

Sonny came over and we decided on a strategy.  We would call a meeting of every company and every squadron.  And we would take the wooden mold of the barrel of the cannon to every meeting.  George Fox, another friend from A Squadron volunteered to help.

What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.

It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
What a wonderful moment.  Every person should have one magic moment in life where they could enjoy something so accepted as "Skipper."  The huge wooden mold of the barrel did its job.  It inspired every member of the Corps.  The meetings, 16 in all, made it evident that never again would the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets go into battle without a gun.

At the end of each meeting, each cadet got up, went back to his room and brought back what he could spare.  We asked each for just one dollar and all of the brass they could give.

They brought their grommets, they brought their brass plates, they brought their old brass buckles.  This cannon would not simply be built with their dollars, but with their hearts.  It is for this reason that you can find the class numerals of 63, 64, 65 and 66 on the face of the barrel.

It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
It was a moving experience.  Sonny and I found it hard to look at each other after each meeting, because we knew we would each see a tear in the eye of the other.  These were the best guys in the world.  We have never seen anything so emotionally supported then or now.  I would not trade that feeling of being a member of a group of which I was so proud for anything in the world.  

 
The Making

The money was raised. We were a little short on brass, but Sonny brought in some brass fittings from his father's mine in West Virginia to fill it out and some bullet casings were gathered from the firing range.  We took them all to the Virginia Foundry Company in Roanoke Virginia.

I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
I had called the President of the Company a few months before and told him what we were about to do after swearing him to secrecy.  I asked him how much it would cost and he astounded me with his response.  You don't have enough, he indicated, but I've thought we needed a cannon for a long time too.  Son, I'm a member of the Corps Class of '37.  We'll be making that barrel for you for nothing.  Just blow the heck out of them for us, will ya.

It was a deal.  He took our brass and wooden mold and set about the task of casting the barrel.  

A few days later I received a phone call from Mr. Hoffman.  He asked where we had gotten the brass for the barrel and I told him the story.  It seems that not all of the shell casings that we picked up from the floor of the firing range were empty.  He said when they poured the brass into the vat for melting everybody was ducking for cover as the foundry was filled with the sound of gunfire.  Well, after all, no good cannon worth it's salt is made without a little effort.  He indicated that the brass we gave him was too soft without support and recommended that we let him add some navy gun metal brass for safety along with ours. It was done.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

Hoffman asked if he could bring in the Roanoke Times on the secret.  I told him yes, if he would wait until the edition that prints directly after the game because we had big plans for VMI, and it absolutely depended on their not knowing.  He agreed, and I knew I could trust him because he was one of us.

It was now time to turn to the carriage.  We found the place that made the old Civil War gun carriages for the National Battle Field Parks like Gettysburg.  It was the Lorton Reformatory, in Lorton, Virginia just outside of Washington D.C.  They were given all of the money that we had saved by not having to pay for the barrel and they agreed to make the carriage to hold "Skipper."

 
The Name

The cannon did not yet have a name.  And we never dreamed of the circumstances that would cause it to have one that were about to unfold.  

Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

March 8, 2000 (GMc)
Time was getting short.  The big game was fast approaching.  Everything was in place.

It was time to pick up the barrel and the carriage.  We rented a truck that Sonny and I drove and a chase car was driven by George Fox and a few others also from A Squadron.

We stopped by the Foundry in Roanoke first to pick up the barrel.  After all, if the barrel was not ready, there was no need to go on to Washington.  The whole foundry turned out.  They were as proud of the barrel as we were.  They shook our hands, wished us well and gave a big Tech cheer as we headed off to get the carriage.

It was a long trip, all the way across the state and the Reformatory was a bit foreboding.  But the carriage was waiting just as promised.  It took all of us to load it into the truck.

We had it!  We had done it! And we were on the way back to show it to the whole Corps.

It was the best feeling in the World.  Nothing like it.  

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.

After about 20 minutes, the chase car that was now a lead car, pulled over on the shoulder and waved us to pull over.  Our truck did not have a radio.  George Fox came back to Sonny and I and indicated that it had just been broadcast that the President had been shot in Dallas and that they did not know how severe it was.  We continued back to Blacksburg not in the exhilaration that we had experienced, but with a tremendous foreboding.  In those days, we did not know whether it was an international plot, whether war was imminent, or what the future would hold.  It was like going from basking in the warm sun to being plunged into the abyss of a cold dark tunnel.  There was no more joy in the trip.  We were quite.

By the time that we arrived back in Blacksburg, we knew that the President was dead.

We felt terrible.  But we wanted to do something in honor of our Head of State.  We remembered an old military tradition that, at the death of a President, all military installations give a 50 gun salute to their fallen leader.  

It was then that we knew what we had to do.  It was then that we knew what we had to name our cannon.  It would be named "Skipper" in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his naval background.

 
The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

But, at the time it was all we could do.  I saw a look in the General's eyes that spoke a thousand words.  Never did he dream when he allowed us to proceed on building the cannon that it would be christened in this way.  It was an emotional moment for all of us.

The first charges for Skipper were made after we bought all of the local stores out of yellow and red plastic catsup and mustard squeeze bottles.  We filled them with super fine black gunpowder.  Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

Placed a cherry bomb on top with two fuses taped together that extended out of the hole where the catsup pours.  We wrapped the bottles tightly with heavy tape so that the charge would explode rather than "poof."  One of us held the charge, the other lit it and slid it down the barrel.  Not exactly how they do it today.  But we were not about to have a cannon on the installation without being able to honor our President.

"Skipper" did just fine.  A tradition was born.

 
The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

We met again just recently for the first time in 35 years.

I remained in the Public Information business that started as PIO for the Corps and turned into becoming the Advertising Director for the Kroger Company.  I am chairman of "Thunder Over Louisville" the Opening Ceremonies of the Kentucky Derby Festival.  It is the largest Fireworks, Light show in the World with over 50 tons of fireworks, 112 World War II searchlights, and 125 aircraft in the show witnessed by a live audience of 600,000 and a televised audience of over two million.  

So you see, we both are still blowing up the world.  The moral of this story is never do anything in college that you don't want to do the rest of your life.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

The Salute

The first firing of "Skipper" would be a 50 round salute to our fallen President.  It would be our test of the barrel's strength and it would be the salute of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.

As we placed "Skipper" in position on the lawn in front of Brodie and Rasche Halls, General Sheve appeared.  Sonny had quickly devised special charges that were quite rudimentary.

The Game

After we found that the Thanksgiving Day game would indeed be held, we immediately began laying plans for introducing "Skipper" to the opposing Corps of Cadets at VMI.

We met with Curt Tompkins, Captain of the "Highty Tighties."  He was brought into the big secret.  We would take the cannon to Roanoke the night before the game and hide it in the stadium.  We would let our Corps and the VMI Corps march in the parade, and into the stadium.  We would take our place in the stands and let the VMI Corps form and take their place as normal.  We would let them bring in "little John," their mortar, and fire it as usual. We would let them chant Where's your cannon," as usual. 

At that time, Sonny and I and George would stand and signal Curt and the Highty Tighties to strike up the march of the Charioteers from Ben Hur.  And 50 Freshman members of the rat class would pull in "Skipper" with two long heavy ropes.  Place it in position aimed directly at the center of the VMI Corps of Cadets and fire it!

And Fire it we did.  Sonny and George placed a charge in the barrel and looked at me as if to ask if that was enough with a twinkle in their eye.  I knew the answer they were looking for. Another would be appropriate and yet another.  We placed a triple charge into the cannon that day.  

What happened after that became legend.  The folks sitting next to the VMI Corps later told us that it blew the hats off of half of the Corps.  And a huge announcement came pounding from the press boxes.  It seems that the reporters had to place their hands on the glass of the press box to keep it from vibrating out of its frame. 

The VMI Corps was quiet - never again to challenge the veracity of our artillery.  The mission was complete.  The duty was done.  The game was won.  Little did we know how this simple act would affect the rest of our lives.

 
The Effect

Sonny went on to fulfill his dream of being in the space program with NASA.  And launchings and firings became a permanent part of his life.  He went on to write the book "October Sky" after retiring and Hollywood turned it into a four star movie.  Now he's writing more books.

So we leave you with this thought.  If anything is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.

The other effect of Skipper hit us at the Syracuse game.  After 35 years something that Sonny and George and I had a small part in creating is still a living symbol of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  You cannot image how great that makes us all feel.  Well done Corps.  You have carried the torch of tradition well.  You have earned the honor and respect of "The Old Corps."

We have passed the torch to you and you have carried it with honor and distinction.

The words of an old General come to mind.  We will always remember The Corps, and the Corps, and the Corps.

		Phone: 540-231-6308Land & Labor AcknowledgmentSite Mapedited by Su Clauson-WickerThe first black women students entered Virginia Tech in the fall of 1966: transfer student Linda Adams, Jacqueline Butler, Linda Edmonds, Fredi Hairston, Marguerite Harper, and Chiquita Hudson. They were a minority within a minority -- six black females in a sea of about 9,500 white men, 500 white women, and 20 black men.It was rough; everyone seemed to be watching. At the end of the first year, Hudson had died of lupus; in another year, Adams had graduated and Hairston had married a white classmate and left school. Harper, Butler, and Edmonds share their memories of moving past barriers to become, with Adams, Tech's first black alumnae.
"I had never heard of Virginia Tech. It was not in my realm," Harper says. She was planning to attend Virginia State, like all her relatives. But when a Virginia Tech recruiter visited her Norfolk high school, earnest about getting black students on campus, she took home an application."My father decided that I would apply. 'Go and teach them about black people; learn about how to live with white people,' he said."She was accepted and received a full scholarship -- a Rockefeller Scholarship for culturally disadvantaged students. "'Take the money and go,' my father said. 'You can teach them who is culturally deprived later.'"Harper was warned by a high-school counselor that she would do poorly because her education was inferior to the white students', but that admonition only gave her more resolve to succeed. She discovered she was in the first class of black women only when her mother read it in Jet magazine in October 1966."The other students were basically kind of indifferent to us. People who lived beside you tended to be more friendly. But, come the weekend, there was this little wall that separated us. They went their way, and you went your way," she says."Most of the racism I experienced was subtle. But not always. I didn't realize how big the flag and 'Dixie' were here until my first football game. The cheerleaders would run onto the field with this huge rebel flag, and then the Highty Tighties would come out playing 'Dixie.' You were expected to stand as if it were the national anthem."There's no way I was standing for 'Dixie.' I remember someone punching me in the back and telling me to stand. I looked at him, and I said, 'You best not put your hands on me again.'"Harper noticed that the Confederate flag came down when important African-Americans, such as Erroll Garner, came to visit. Obviously they felt that this would be insulting to him. "Why don't they think it's insulting to me?" she asked. She was elected to the student senate her sophomore year and made a successful resolution to get rid of Dixie and the flag."We received hate mail and ugly telephone calls. My roommate at the time, Natalia Herdami, was white, and so she got threatening phone calls about living with me ... There was a demonstration. This campus was covered in Confederate flags hanging out of the windows. 'Dixie' was blasting out of the doors. I had a Nina Simone protest-song record that I used to play on Sundays for parents of the girls who wouldn't speak to me. I'd open my door and have my 'Mississippi, God Damn' playing out there until my roommate would say, 'Come on, now; give them a break.' That was my way of dealing with it."I remember having to have that facade at that point. When I first came here, I was a sweet child. By the time I left, I was Umoja black power. I guess I tried to become intimidating as a defense mechanism to survive."When the Supreme Court struck down miscegenation laws in 1967, the university human relations council that Harper attended decided to test the ruling on campus. Harper and a white classmate set up a "date" one reunion weekend."When fellows came to see a girl, they'd have to ask the dorm mother to call her to come downstairs. There was a substitute there, and she asked my date, 'Do you know that she's a colored girl? I'm not going to call her for you.' And so he had to get a another girl to let me know he was there."We sat on the faculty/alumni side of the concert. We wanted the old people to see us. Sure enough, the next day the dean of women called me in and let me know that she had seen me and that I looked so nice and what have you. She said one lady had asked, 'Did you see that colored girl and that white boy last night? What are you gonna do about it?' And the dean told her, 'What do you mean, what am I gonna do about it? Here at Virginia Tech, students can date whomever they please.' She knew what I was doing, obviously. That was to let me know: 'Back off. I'm not gonna bother you folks anymore.'"After graduation, Harper taught in Norfolk City schools during the year when busing began and schools were integrated. She is still teaching school in Cary, N.C., where she lives with her husband and two children."I don't look back with regret," she says, "I wanted to make things happen. This was a grand place for me to do it. We were the first. They didn't know what to do with us, apparently. We had to be paired together, and I roomed with a white girl the next year because, hey, we're not going to do it the way you want us to do it. I felt somewhat like a pioneer, and I think that molded how I was going to be for the rest of my life."Hairston came to Tech from Roanoke and roomed with Linda Edmonds in Hillcrest during their freshman year. Both Hairston and Edmonds joined the University Choir. Hairston was on the news staff of the student newspaper, Virginia Tech. She and Larry Billion (psychology '69) wrote "Back Talk," a column that dealt with controversial issues and presented both sides of the topics.In the fall of 1967, they did a column on miscegenation, which concluded with "The children of an interracial marriage are the only victims of miscegenation. This is solely because of the hypocrisy and cruelty of man. The day is coming when people will realize that the ostracism of children because of their heritage is meaningless."Hairston married Tech junior Robert Clegg, a white civil rights activist, at the end of her sophomore year, and they both left Virginia Tech.Jackie Butler graduated at the top of her class in Lancaster County, Va., and came to Tech on a $4,000 Rockefeller scholarship. Before Tech, she had little contact with whites and no expectations about what she would encounter."The girls in the dorm were fine -- we were all friends. I never had any problems in the dorm, but in the cafeteria ... sometimes when we sat at a table, the students would get up and move to another table. That was only the first year. The students, once they got to know you, were fine. Once you had interacted with them, race wasn't important."The first year was the hardest. You would feel like everyone was staring at you. And I remember sometimes walking across the Drillfield when it was cold, and I would think that if I fainted here, no one would care. I would wonder if anyone would stop or if they would just keep going."Butler still communicates with some of her white friends, including a special friend who's a missionary in Uganda. She had white roommates her last two years of school and spent her last semester in Germany living with a German family. She married Eli Blackwell (mechanical engineering '70) the fall after she graduated. (She graduated in three years.) Butler held training positions at the Virginia Employment Commission before their first child was born. Since then, she's been active in volunteer work, for the last six year as director of a volunteer program for her daughters' high school in Portsmouth, Va. Both her daughters, Lori and Stacy, are attending Tech.Chiquita Hudson, from Hampton, had a single room because she had lupus and didn't want to disturb her roommate when she was ill. When the parents of the white roommate assigned to Linda Adams, a transfer student from Clifton Forge, refused to have their daughter room with Adams, Hudson moved in with Adams. Hudson died of lupus the summer after her freshman year.Linda Edmonds graduated with top grades in Halifax County, Va., and came to Virginia Tech to major in clothing and textiles. She had visited campus in high school, thought of it as "a little fairyland, with buildings like castles," but had no notion of going to a white institution until that visit. The offer of a full scholarship to Virginia Tech from the Rockefeller Foundation also affected her decision."I was the only black student in my high school going to a white university then. The tension was building all summer. I started to really get afraid that I couldn't make it. Not so much that I didn't think that I had it, this was a totally different environment."Edmonds says she and Hairston, her roommate, mixed right in at Hillcrest. "We did whatever the other girls did. There were pajama parties. We'd go; they might not have wanted us to, but we were there. We never considered ourselves uninvited.""Our dorm mother, Mrs. Reynolds, was really sweet and southern and very hospitable to us. Some of the girls' parents' eyes got as big as saucers when they saw us. Sometimes when the parents would visit, they would ask us, 'Where do I get paper towels?' They thought Fredi and I were the hired help."Edmonds tried to develop a relationship with a white student from her hometown. "I used to have to make her talk. I was determined, but not aggressive. She didn't want to talk to me, but as the years went by, she would talk more. She was always judging whether she should do it or not."Edmond's biggest support came from a few staff and faculty members. "The black staff that cooked for Hillcrest treated Fredi and me just like queens. You could just see the pride in their faces. They would do little things, such as saving our favorites foods for us. Sometimes I'd see them outside the dorm, and they would say, 'We're proud of you. Just get your lessons, and don't let these folks bother you. We know it's hard, but you guys are the first!'"Laura Jean Harper, dean of the College of Home Economics, was Edmond's true mentor. "Dean Harper hired me as her undergraduate teaching assistant. That woman continued to groom me, but I didn't even know it was happening. She would do things like this: she would say, 'Linda, take this report over to the president's office.' I used to wonder why. She was giving me exposure. I still talk to the former president (T. Marshall Hahn). He has been a mentor to me as well throughout the years. Dean Harper gave me that connection."She was a very abrupt, busy, busy person. She wasn't fake. If she didn't like something, you knew it. I thrived with her kind of guidance and the responsibility she gave me. I think she sent the message to the other faculty not to give me anything, but to be fair."I don't know if I would be sitting here today with a Ph.D. if it hadn't been for Dean Harper encouraging me. I'm first generation college. I decided to get a master's. She went to Michigan State, and I went there. Then I came back to Tech and got a Ph.D. in business in 1979."Once she stepped out of the home economics building, Edmonds felt like a shadow. "Sometimes I saw racism on campus, but it was done subtly. Then there was some that just hit you dead in the face."A graduate teaching assistant taught the chemistry lab -- he would always just glare at me. He was red and fat and swollen, he reminded me of the term 'redneck.' One day a bottle of acid solution got knocked off the counter onto my legs. It completely ate the hose off my legs. I just froze. My lab partner froze. The guy behind us took some water and started pouring it on my legs to wash this solution off. The teacher came over and said, in a rough voice, 'You be more careful next time,' and walked away. Never looked to see if I had been injured. That little boy -- he couldn't have been any more than 18 either -- said to me, 'Linda, I think you need to go to the bathroom and take those off.'"I walked out, and I started to shake. Dr. Furch, the chemistry professor, came down the hall and asked me what was wrong. When I told him, he got down on his knees to look at my legs -- not in a sexual or familiar way, but concerned. 'Miss Edmonds,' he said, 'you leave the lab immediately. Go take a hot bath, and if you feel any sort of stinging, go to the infirmary right away.' He reassured me that it was a weak solution and shouldn't bother me."Edmonds said the lab instructor gave her a B rather than an A in the lab because she missed that class."If I could thank two people that I never did thank properly, it would be Dr. Furch and that little boy who washed my legs off. Dr. Furch only had one hand. If I could, I would grow him another hand. He seemed to care; a lot of the teachers didn't. I was there, and I did well, but they didn't give a damn one way or the other."Edmonds made the dean's list, but felt driven to achieve. "I regret going through that period feeling I couldn't have a bad day. It was tough. I wonder if part of the reason the black students haven't really kept in contact is that we were so busy just trying to hold on then that when it was over, it was like a breath of air. We just went our separate ways."In some respects, Tech made me feel like a stepchild. It's my school and, even though we participated in everything, nobody cared that we did or didn't. I was lucky in that I had Dean Harper, but others didn't."Edmonds, now Linda Turner, lives with her husband and son in Massachusetts, where she is assistant vice president of marketing at Dean College.Thirty years later, 495 black women are enrolled at Virginia Tech. Tech's total black student enrollment is 1,064, or about 4.3 percent of the university's total. Public administration doctoral candidate Elaine Carter, who initiated the Black Women's History Project at the Virginia Tech Women's Center, says some black students on campus report feeling defensive, lonely, and marginalized. "The risk (to engage) is usually taken by the black student," she says. "Racism hasn't completely disappeared, but you find few willing to talk about it."The university, however, has established programs to increase dialogue and awareness, including a multicultural awareness program led by student peer educators, a Black Cultural Center, and an orientation video dealing with racial issues.This article was based on interviews by Elaine Carter and University Archivist Tamara Kennelly, located at scholar2.lib.vt.edu/spec/bwhp/bwhproj

Realism
              in every detail is the theme of the 1971 class ring. Many new
              features establish its uniqueness while conveying the class motto,
              "Spirit With New Traditions."
THE
              BEZEL leads the way in the break from tradition as Virginia
              Polytechnic reads clockwise and Institute reads counterclockwise
              around the stone. Modified Roman is used here and throughout the
              design for unity.Dividing
              the wording are two identical atomic shells, symbols of modern
              technology and broadening horizons.A
              unique "71" chain completes the bezel. The 7's and 1's,
              which can be read from top to bottom on either side of the stone,
              are the links in the chain to show class unity and strength.
(Note
              - The name of the college changed July 1, 1970 to include
              "State University" to accurately reflect the scope of
              the college's teachings. Although the Class of 1971 was the first
              to graduate under the new name, the class ring bezel did not
              reflect the name change because the ring design was finalized before
              the name change.)
The 
				1971 class
              rings are composed of a University or history side, and a
              Curriculum or modern side. Pride in America was the underlying
              idea, using realism as the vehicle for expression.
THE
              UNIVERSITY SIDE

              begins with the 1971 numerals placed together at
              the top. Forming their background is the American flag of the year
              of our founding, 1872.In
              another "first" the University shield has been placed to
              the left of center below the numerals.Darting
              along the right of the shield is a fierce, realistic eagle, a
              traditional element of the Tech ring. Partially concealing the
              eagle's wing is a furled Confederate flag, a symbol of Virginia's
              history, plus Tech's well known school spirit. (Note - this was
              the last Tech ring to include, without option, the Confederate
              flag, an element
              traditionally found on Tech rings up to this point)
              Clutched in
              the eagle's talons is a banner proclaiming the University's motto
              "Ut Prosim" - That I May Serve.The
              Corps of Cadets sabre pierces the banner and disappears behind an
              open book and the lamp of knowledge, all of which form the
              closing.

			  Laurel leaves transcend to the palm side to connect the past with 
			  future.
THE
              CURRICULUM SIDE
              boasts an identical asymmetrical balance. Again
              the numerals are together but with a modern-day
              American flag background. To balance the University shank, the Curriculum
              shield is to the left of center.Directly
              below the shield is a bold, furling Virginia flag, as new and
              greater emphasis is put on this element.The
              right side has many innovations that add to the growing number of
              "firsts". The torch of learning is raised high as a
              guiding light. "The Skipper" is easily recognized as a symbol
              of school spirit plus military bearing. A strong Va Tech banner
              encircles a fasces lichtor, symbol of justice through authority. A
              realistic fightin' gobbler completes the right side.The
              VT symbol forms the closing of a perfectly balanced design story
              of the history and the opportunities of Virginia Tech.


















































THE RING
          TRADITION





Virginia
          Tech is one of only a few colleges and universities that maintains a
          class ring tradition. The Ring program is distinctive from other
          colleges in that the entire ring collection is redesigned
          for each class, and rings are presented at a formal Ring Dance.
The Virginia Tech Class Ring Tradition began with the Class
          of 1914, the first to choose a student committee to design a ring that
          would be meaningful to the Class. The Class Ring Design Committee
          since that time has been selected during the sophomore year and is
          responsible for creating a collection unique to each Class.
          Traditional ring collection elements have changed somewhat over time
          and currently include: the screaming eagle, American
          flag, campus buildings and an interlocking chain around the bezel. From
          there, the Ring Committee designs a class ring representing the unique
          characteristics of their respective class.
Since
          1991, the ring design process includes the selection of a Class
          namesake. This is done as a dedication to a distinguished alumnus or
          university president.
Established
          by the Class of 1935, the Ring Dance weekend takes places in the
          spring of a student’s junior year. The two-day celebration includes
          a banquet honoring the ring collection’s namesake, the formal Ring
          Dance and fireworks.
The
          strong ring tradition at Tech inspires most students to order rings.
          The large number of orders and the large physical size of the rings
          (up to 40 dwt) make the Tech class ring the prestige order
          of the of the college ring business. The result is fierce
          competition between the major ring manufacturers for Tech's class ring
          business. This competition contributes to the remarkable quality,
          distinctive designs and generous manufacturer guarantees for which Tech rings are traditionally known.
          Manufacturers that have made Tech rings in the past include Bailey,
          Banks and Biddle; Charles Elliott; George Spies; Dieges and Clust;
          John Roberts; Herff-Jones; Balfour and Jostens.
The company that was awarded the privilege of making Tech's 
			  1971 class ring was Jostens. Jostens 1971 Class Ring guarantee...
          Jostens will at any time:
          	~  resize the ring at no
          charge
          	~  replace broken encrusting
          at no charge if stone is undamaged
			  ~  replace the ring for any

The
          Class Program, through the advising of the Virginia Tech Alumni

Realism
              in every detail is the theme of the 1971 class ring. Many new
              features establish its uniqueness while conveying the class motto,
              "Spirit With New Traditions."
THE
              BEZEL leads the way in the break from tradition as Virginia
              Polytechnic reads clockwise and Institute reads counterclockwise
              around the stone. Modified Roman is used here and throughout the
              design for unity.Dividing
              the wording are two identical atomic shells, symbols of modern
              technology and broadening horizons.A
              unique "71" chain completes the bezel. The 7's and 1's,
              which can be read from top to bottom on either side of the stone,
              are the links in the chain to show class unity and strength.
(Note
              - The name of the college changed July 1, 1970 to include
              "State University" to accurately reflect the scope of
              the college's teachings. Although the Class of 1971 was the first
              to graduate under the new name, the class ring bezel did not
              reflect the name change because the ring design was finalized before
              the name change.)
The 
				1971 class
              rings are composed of a University or history side, and a
              Curriculum or modern side. Pride in America was the underlying
              idea, using realism as the vehicle for expression.
THE
              UNIVERSITY SIDE

              begins with the 1971 numerals placed together at
              the top. Forming their background is the American flag of the year
              of our founding, 1872.In
              another "first" the University shield has been placed to
              the left of center below the numerals.Darting
              along the right of the shield is a fierce, realistic eagle, a
              traditional element of the Tech ring. Partially concealing the
              eagle's wing is a furled Confederate flag, a symbol of Virginia's
              history, plus Tech's well known school spirit. (Note - this was
              the last Tech ring to include, without option, the Confederate
              flag, an element
              traditionally found on Tech rings up to this point)
              Clutched in
              the eagle's talons is a banner proclaiming the University's motto
              "Ut Prosim" - That I May Serve.The
              Corps of Cadets sabre pierces the banner and disappears behind an
              open book and the lamp of knowledge, all of which form the
              closing.

			  Laurel leaves transcend to the palm side to connect the past with 
			  future.
THE
              CURRICULUM SIDE
              boasts an identical asymmetrical balance. Again
              the numerals are together but with a modern-day
              American flag background. To balance the University shank, the Curriculum
              shield is to the left of center.Directly
              below the shield is a bold, furling Virginia flag, as new and
              greater emphasis is put on this element.The
              right side has many innovations that add to the growing number of
              "firsts". The torch of learning is raised high as a
              guiding light. "The Skipper" is easily recognized as a symbol
              of school spirit plus military bearing. A strong Va Tech banner
              encircles a fasces lichtor, symbol of justice through authority. A
              realistic fightin' gobbler completes the right side.The
              VT symbol forms the closing of a perfectly balanced design story
              of the history and the opportunities of Virginia Tech.


















































THE RING
          TRADITION





Virginia
          Tech is one of only a few colleges and universities that maintains a
          class ring tradition. The Ring program is distinctive from other
          colleges in that the entire ring collection is redesigned
          for each class, and rings are presented at a formal Ring Dance.
The Virginia Tech Class Ring Tradition began with the Class
          of 1914, the first to choose a student committee to design a ring that
          would be meaningful to the Class. The Class Ring Design Committee
          since that time has been selected during the sophomore year and is
          responsible for creating a collection unique to each Class.
          Traditional ring collection elements have changed somewhat over time
          and currently include: the screaming eagle, American
          flag, campus buildings and an interlocking chain around the bezel. From
          there, the Ring Committee designs a class ring representing the unique
          characteristics of their respective class.
Since
          1991, the ring design process includes the selection of a Class
          namesake. This is done as a dedication to a distinguished alumnus or
          university president.
Established
          by the Class of 1935, the Ring Dance weekend takes places in the
          spring of a student’s junior year. The two-day celebration includes
          a banquet honoring the ring collection’s namesake, the formal Ring
          Dance and fireworks.
The
          strong ring tradition at Tech inspires most students to order rings.
          The large number of orders and the large physical size of the rings
          (up to 40 dwt) make the Tech class ring the prestige order
          of the of the college ring business. The result is fierce
          competition between the major ring manufacturers for Tech's class ring
          business. This competition contributes to the remarkable quality,
          distinctive designs and generous manufacturer guarantees for which Tech rings are traditionally known.
          Manufacturers that have made Tech rings in the past include Bailey,
          Banks and Biddle; Charles Elliott; George Spies; Dieges and Clust;
          John Roberts; Herff-Jones; Balfour and Jostens.
The company that was awarded the privilege of making Tech's 
			  1971 class ring was Jostens. Jostens 1971 Class Ring guarantee...

The
          Class Program, through the advising of the Virginia Tech Alumni
          Association, maintains the tradition of the Virginia Tech Class Ring.
          Through the Association, alumni must have their class year confirmed
          before either ordering or replacing a ring to ensure the continued
          integrity of the program. (Actually,

Clement Heth looked down at his brother, Stockton Heth Jr., in his bed at Roanoke’s Jefferson Hospital. By him stood Redmond Roop, commonwealth’s attorney for Montgomery County, and Dr. A. P. Jones, the attending physician.Clement took shorthand notes that he would later give to the Roanoke Times. Dr. Jones had told him these might be his brother's last words. Roop had been summoned earlier that night, taking the train up from Christiansburg.“Let me go to sleep, Clem,” Stockton replied, “and then, I’ll tell you all about it.”“I’m afraid that if you go to sleep, you’ll never wake up.”Stockton’s intestines were punctured in five places, and another bullet had pierced one of his kidneys. Doctors had found him on the floor of Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) professor Charles Vawter Jr.’s house. After a preliminary examination in Blacksburg, he was taken to Roanoke for emergency surgery. However, the surgical techniques of the day could not save him.“All right, then, what is it?”“Who shot you, Stock?”“Mr. Vawter.”“Charlie Vawter?”“Yes.”“Why did he shoot you?”“He hasn’t got a thing to stand on, Clem.”“Do you mean he had no reason?”“Yes,” Stockton replied. “Let me go to sleep.”The wounded man fell back into an unconscious state. He died at 4:55 a.m.Looking south on Jefferson Street in Roanoke in 1918.Charles Erastus Vawter Jr. was born in 1877, the son of Charles Erastus Vawter Sr. and Virginia Longley. The senior Vawter served in the Confederate Army’s Stonewall Brigade as a captain before being captured in the last months of the war.He went on to graduate from Emory and Henry College in 1866, the same year he married Longley. He did some coursework at the University of Virginia before working as a mathematics professor at his alma mater for a decade. In 1878, he left to help found the Miller Manual Labor School in Albemarle, Virginia, where he stayed until his death in 1905.In 1886, Virginia Gov. Fitzhugh Lee asked Vawter to ply his organizational skills at the floundering Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (VAMC) in Blacksburg — the school that would become Virginia Tech. He served as rector of the Board of Visitors until 1900, helping to turn the college around and setting it on track to become the major university it is today. Vawter Hall, a residence hall on Tech’s campus, is named after him.Charles Vawter Jr. in the 1913 Bugle yearbook.His son, however, does not have a building named after him. After attending the Miller School, Charles Vawter Jr. enrolled at the University of Virginia. He graduated in 1898 with majors in math and physics. Immediately afterward, Charles Vawter Jr. found a position at VPI, the new name of VAMC. We are left to speculate if his father might have pulled a few strings to arrange that.In 1898, the math and physics departments merged, allowing Vawter to hold the title of Acting Professor of Mathematics and Physics (the acting was dropped after a probationary first year). This arrangement continued until 1900, when the departments once again split and Vawter became the chair of the physics department.Vawter also took after his father’s love of technology and machinery. In 1883, Charles Vawter Sr. installed an Edison dynamo at the Miller School, making it one of the first schools in the south to install electric lights.Charles Vawter Jr. was a quite brilliant inventor, actually. In 1905, he filed a patent for a device that would record output from devices such as a voltmeter on paper. Over his lifetime, he would invent more than 200 radio and electrical devices. His patents included a pneumatic tire, a rail bond tester, a fuel gauge for motor vehicles, an electrical impedance meter — the list is too long to put here.William Tams Jr., a 1902 graduate of VPI, later recalled that Vawter was “clever and well liked” and paid for the football team’s train tickets to go to away games. In 1903, he published a book based on lectures he attended at London’s Central Technical College, and the 1913 Bugle yearbook was dedicated to him.“A son and a grandson of professors, high intellectuality is a marked characteristic of (Vawter’s) mentality,” wrote Theodorick Campbell, then a professor of modern languages, in the yearbook. “In character he is honest, truthful, and conscientious in the discharge of his duties, as well as in other relations of life.”Campbell would not always hold Vawter in such high regard. Especially not after he shot one of his best friends.Science Hall, the home of the VPI physics department, in 1918.Rachel Henderson was born in 1882 to Thomas Henderson and Polly McConkey, and would grow up at the center of Salem’s burgeoning society scene.She attended Salem High School, where she was a regular feature on the school’s honor roll. In addition to her good grades, she was very active in the school’s literary societies. And, of course, she was quite popular with the boys. The Roanoke Times would later say she was “one of the most beautiful women in Virginia.”By all accounts, she also was a bit of a traditionalist, settling into the acceptable routine for a wealthy young lady at the time. In her junior year at Salem High School, the Roanoke Daily Times recounted a debate she participated in, put on by the literary societies. Henderson and her partner argued that “women should be censured for bicycle riding.” The judges found the opposing team’s argument more convincing.After graduating in 1897, Henderson organized parties, attended dances and made appearances in the society pages of the Salem Times-Register and Roanoke Times. In particular, she went to or hosted a number of balls at Roanoke College or the Salem Cotillion Club. She never had the same partner twice in newspaper accounts.An undated photograph of Rachel Henderson that appeared in the May 1, 1917, edition of the Roanoke Times.Henderson also visited Blacksburg quite frequently. Her uncle, Dr. William Henderson, had been one of the first VAMC students and came back in 1891 as the college physician. In 1902, he helped establish the college infirmary in what is now Henderson Hall. For many years, he was a fixture in the Blacksburg community, chaperoning dances, attending football games and making house calls.Perhaps Henderson met Vawter when she visited Blacksburg in June 1900. If not then, maybe when she spent a month there in 1901, or during a stay with her uncle in April 1902.Vawter also made a visit to Salem in June 1902 that was publicized in the Richmond Dispatch’s society pages. It is quite possible that the June visit was to propose. Henderson attended her last dance as Ms. Rachel Henderson at the Salem-Roanoke German Club on June 10, 1902, in the company of Dr. G. E. Koontz.On Aug. 20, Vawter and Henderson announced their wedding in the Richmond Dispatch, which wrote that the “wedding promises to be one of Salem’s most fashionable society events.” The paper noted that Henderson “has been noted both at home and abroad for her beauty and charm of person.” Vawter was called “a young man of great ability and popularity.”The two were wed Sept. 3, 1902, at 9 p.m. (night owls, I guess) in the Salem Presbyterian Church, decorated with palms that reminded the Dispatch of “fairyland.” A reception was held that night at the Henderson’s home on Main Street in Salem before they headed off on their honeymoon in Niagara Falls, New York.The Vawter home in 1917, as printed in the Roanoke Times.The Vawters returned to Blacksburg later that month to a warm welcome. Hundreds of VPI cadets gave the Vawters a calathump in early October in commemoration of the marriage, beating tin pans and blowing horns outside Henderson’s house. The citizens of Blacksburg were not pleased.The couple eventually took up residence in a house on Faculty Row, located on campus on the north side of what is now the Drillfield. Their first house was located approximately where McBryde Hall is now. In 1915, that home was torn down to make way for a new building, and the family moved to a house located near what is now the east end of Pamplin Hall.The Vawters had two children: Charles Erastus Vawter III in 1906 and Rachel Henderson Vawter around 1908. They lived what appeared to be quite a happy life. Charles Vawter was an active Mason, Rachel Henderson continued to chaperone dances and the couple remained quite visible on the Blacksburg social scene.A map of campus in 1915.If Rachel Vawter’s romantic endeavors seem odd when compared to her background, then Stockton Heth Jr. was the man you might have expected her to marry. Heth was born in 1879 to Stockton Heth Sr. and Isabella Hammett, one of the most — if not the most — prominent families in Montgomery County (yes, Heth as in Hethwood Apartment Homes).The senior Heth was born in 1839 and fought as a captain in the Confederate Army before marrying Hammett in October 1867. Hammett had grown up in Radford and inherited the estate on which the eastern part of Radford is built.Heth was the president of the Exchange Bank of Radford and, after the marriage, one of the largest landowners in the county. Property he owned, including a stretch of woods known as Heth Grove, became the location of the State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Radford. That school is known today as Radford University. Heth’s old home was used as a residence hall, and Heth Hall on campus is named for the family.In 1889, when Stockton Heth Jr. was 10, his family purchased Whitethorn, the farm of the late James Francis Preston. The family spent many summers on the 1,500-acre estate that stretched for miles between Blacksburg and Radford.Stockton Heth Jr. stood 6 feet tall and weighed nearly 200 pounds, quite imposing for the time. After graduating from St. Albans Lutheran School for Boys in Radford (which is now a paranormal attraction), Heth really didn’t do much. His job was technically to run Whitethorn, but let’s be honest — that was not his real focus.An undated portrait of James Hoge Tyler, governor of Virginia and Stockton Heth Jr.’s uncle.Heth instead kept himself in local society pages, attending dances and events. He did raise horses; one of his, Bohemian Gray, placed in several competitions.On his mother’s side, his aunt was married to James Hoge Tyler, governor of Virginia from 1898 to 1902. Stockton Heth Jr. was frequently mentioned in society pages as a visitor of his. After Tyler underwent surgery in Roanoke in 1911, The Evening News of Roanoke reported that Heth drove him to his home, Halwyck, in his new “easy riding car.”When Heth wasn’t hosting dances and events, he was in attendance. He became a frequent visitor of the VPI German Club, showing up to midwinter, Easter and Thanksgiving dances for many years, either stag or with a new girl. He was known for his flirtatious behavior.“Heth’s marked affections to married women in the past have been the cause of considerable criticism and it is understood that in social circles, he has been the object of rebuke,” the Roanoke Times wrote after his death.In the years leading up to 1917, people had begun to notice that Rachel Vawter and Heth had gotten quite close. Heth was a frequent visitor to the Vawter home in Blacksburg and had been seen driving about with Rachel Vawter in his automobile. However, this all appeared to be with Charles Vawter’s consent and little was thought of it.Of course, that was until March 13, 1917.Ellett’s Drugstore and the post office in Blacksburg, 1910.Dr. William Henderson’s phone rang around 2:45 a.m. on March 13. It was Charles Vawter. Stockton Heth had been shot in his home; the doctor better come quickly. Right as Vawter was finishing, Dr. Henderson’s doorbell rang.On his doorstep was Bernard “Bull” Williams, a senior at VPI studying agriculture. A regular German Club attendee, he rented a room from the Vawters. His 1917 Bugle entry described him as “ever ready to assist in time of trouble” and that the authors had “never seen him angry.”“For God’s sake, come at once!” Williams told Dr. Henderson, as he would later recount in court.While Dr. Henderson headed toward the Vawters’ house, Williams ran to get another Blacksburg doctor, Dr. T. B. Ellett.They arrived at about the same time and went inside the home. On the second floor of the house at the top of the main stairs, they found Heth lying in his pajamas with a blanket draped over his body. He was still conscious. Rachel Vawter was nearby; her husband was in their bedroom.(From left to right) Theodorick Campbell, dean of VPI faculty, in the 1917 Bugle yearbook; Clarence “Sally” Miles, Charles Vawter Jr.’s brother-in-law and former VPI football coach, in the 1915 Bugle yearbook; and Bernard "Bull" Williams in the 1917 Bugle yearbook.After administering an anesthetic, Heth asked the doctors to call Theodorick Campbell, a close friend of his. Dr. Henderson used Vawter’s phone to call Campbell, who was the dean of faculty at VPI. Campbell, after hearing the news, also called Clarence “Sally” Miles, who was Vawter’s brother-in-law, a VPI professor and a former football coach. Miles had led VPI to its first football victory over the University of Virginia; the school’s football field and track at the time was named after him.The doctors then went into the bedroom where Charles Vawter was and asked him to hand over the pistol used. Vawter went to a dresser and withdrew the gun, a .32-caliber Iver Johnson revolver. Three of its five cartridges had been fired.Heth was driven down the street from the Vawter’s house to the college infirmary, now Henderson Hall, for further examination. A nurse, Emma Garrison, was on hand to help. There were three bullet wounds in his lower left abdomen: at least two of the bullets appeared to have gone through the same entry wound. One appeared to still be lodged in Heth’s body.The doctors would need to operate immediately. The holes in Heth’s intestines meant that their contents could spill out, increasing the risk of a dangerous infection. Today, the death rate for penetrating abdominal trauma such as a bullet wound is about five percent at a comprehensive trauma center, according to Medscape.But let’s think about it — the college infirmary in 1917 fell way short of that. The infirmary had been the college president’s house before being converted in 1902. And, before World War I, abdominal gunshot wounds were nearly always fatal, no matter who treated it or where it was treated.Dr. William Henderson in the VPI infirmary during the 1902–03 academic year.They also summoned Dr. A. P. Jones, one of the few surgeons in the area who worked at Jefferson Hospital in Roanoke. He came down as soon as possible to help. When he arrived, Heth was still conscious and answering questions intelligibly, a good sign.Heth was taken on the No. 17 Norfolk and Western train to Roanoke, where an ambulance was waiting. Dr. Jones, Dr. Henderson and another doctor started surgery shortly after noon, about nine hours after Heth had been found in the Vawter’s home. The single bullet in Heth’s abdomen was removed and the other wounds were stitched during the two-hour surgery.Meanwhile, Heth’s relatives began to converge on the hospital. Lt. Clement Heth was stationed with the Army at Fort Hunt near Washington, D.C., and came down after he received a telegram. His sisters, Virginia and Sally Heth, also in D.C. at the time, came down too. However, his father was in California — it would take days to cross the country.For the first 24 hours after the operation, it seemed as though Heth might pull through. However, by 9 p.m. on March 14, it was apparent that the early optimism had been mislaid. Although Dr. Jones would say in court that the “shock” of the wound had killed Heth, it was more likely an infection. Virginia and Sally Heth spent most of the night beside the patient’s bed.When it became apparent that he would not survive, the Heth family placed a long-distance call to commonwealth’s attorney Redmond Roop of Montgomery County. Roop had gone to the Vawter home to collect evidence earlier that day, although little of note was found. As required by law, Roop came as soon as he could to Roanoke to take Heth’s dying statement.Heth died at 4:55 a.m. on March 15, 1917. His body was turned over to undertaker John Oakey. His siblings made the sad trek back to Radford, where Heth’s mother was buried in the family cemetery four years prior. His father did not arrive until March 17.Main Street and the railroad yards in Radford in 1897.Although the doctors acted fairly quickly, law enforcement did not. That was probably because in all of the hullabaloo, nobody thought to — or maybe no one wanted to — call the sheriff. The college marshal had been summoned, but Heth was on his way to Roanoke before a warrant was issued.The first Deputy Sheriff C. M. Camper heard of it was after 8 a.m. on March 13, over five hours after Charles Vawter called Dr. Henderson. The justice of the peace, W. R. Stanger, heard about the shooting when his niece phoned him to see if he had any information around 10 a.m. Stanger contacted Camper and afterward issued a warrant for Charles Vawter’s arrest.State of Virginia,County of Montgomery, to-wit:To the Sheriff of said County:Whereas, C. M. Camper has this day made complaint and information on oath before me, W. R. Stranger, a justice of the peace in and for said county, that on or before the 13th day of March, 1917, in the said county, Prof. C. E. Vawter did unlawfully, feloniously and maliciously, with a certain dangerous and deadly weapon, towit: pistol, loaded with gunpowder and leaden bullets, shoot, wound, kill, and murder Stockton Heth, Jr.These are, therefore, in the name of the Commonwealth of Virginia to command and bring before me or some other justice of the peace of the said county, the body of the said Prof. C. E. Vawter to answer said complaint and to be further dealt with according to law.And moreover upon the arrest of the said C. E. Vawter by virtue of this warrant, I command you in the name of the Commonwealth of Virginia to summon Dr. W. F. Henderson, Dr. T. B. Elliott, and Bernard Williams to appear at the time and place of this warrant as witnesses to testify in behalf of the Commonwealth against the said C. E. Vawter, that is to say, on the next day following the day of arrest, and have then and there these witnesses and this warrant with your return thereon.Given under my hand this 15th day of March, 1917.W. R. STANGER, J.(as printed in The World News of Roanoke, March 16, 1917)Vawter called Camper after hearing about the warrant and asked to meet him at the afternoon train on the Huckleberry line to Christiansburg, where he would post bail. He did indeed show up, along with two other VPI faculty: Miles and William Brodie, an associate professor of mathematics and a 1901 graduate of VPI.In Christiansburg, the bail commissioner released him on a $1,000 bond, paid by Miles and Brodie. Vawter’s attorneys, Allen Harless and William Colhoun of the Christiansburg firm Harless and Colhoun helped secure his release. Vawter was back in Blacksburg a free man before 7 p.m. that night.When Heth died, Stanger drew up a new warrant for Vawter’s arrest.Vawter once again appeared before the bail commissioner the day after Heth’s death, this time accompanied by Camper; Miles; Colonel Sidney Sheltman, a wealthy Montgomery County citizen; and Charles Wade, the vice president of the Bank of Christiansburg. The three posted Vawter’s $10,000 bond, allowing him to return to Blacksburg that afternoon. Later that day, a Roanoke Times reporter saw him walking with his wife on campus.The Huckleberry depot in Blacksburg, taken around 1912–13.The news of the shooting made it to the press on March 14. Next to front page stories about a major railroad strike and the fighting on the Western front in Europe, the Richmond Times-Dispatch ran “Mystery shrouds shooting of Heth.”The stories were light on detail and heavy on speculation; Vawter refused to talk to the press. He went to his house where his wife was waiting, and the Roanoke Times said that they continued to see visitors, although they refused to talk about the shooting.After his arraignment for murder, Vawter’s counsel released a statement to satiate the press. Reporters had been chomping at the bit since Clement Heth recounted to a Roanoke Times reporter his brother’s last words.“In view of the account published by the press of what is purported to be the dying statement of Stockton Heth, Jr., as to the circumstances leading up to his shooting, counsel for Professor C. E. Vawter, of the opinion that it would serve no good purpose for their client to make any detailed statement at this time other than to say that after a thorough investigation of the surrounding facts culminating in the unfortunate tragedy, the evidence will disclose a betrayal of friendship and confidence reposed. The day has not come when the honor of a Virginia home is no longer assured and we feel that our client will have nothing to fear at the hands of a jury of his countrymen.”(statement by Harless and Colhoun to the press, as printed by the Roanoke Times)When the attorneys announced that the cause of the shooting was a “betrayal of friendship,” the press immediately latched on. Stories were already circulating about the closeness of Heth and Rachel Vawter — it was supposed that the trial would hinge around her “honor.” The news of the defense strategy appeared in papers from The Washington Times of Washington, D.C., (“Home sanctity plea advanced in Heth killing”) to The Tacoma Times of Tacoma, Washington, (“Professor will plead the ‘unwritten law’”).It was not that the newspapers were exceptionally desperate for content. On March 15, Czar Nicholas II of Russia abdicated, setting the stage for the Soviet takeover of the country (The World News of Roanoke declared it the “most orderly revolution (the) world has ever witnessed”). It was just that the thought of the beautiful wife of a brilliant professor cheating on her husband was too salacious to resist.The newspapers and public would have to wait until May, when the trial was scheduled to begin, to find out more.The front page of the World News of Roanoke, March 16, 1917.The May 1917 term of the Montgomery County Circuit Court, held by Judge William Moffett, convened at 9 a.m. on May 1, 1917. The first item on the docket: the murder trial of Charles Vawter Jr.Moffett, born 1854 in Culpeper County, was admitted to the bar in 1877. He had been elected to the Virginia State Legislature and worked as an attorney in Washington, D.C., before he was appointed to his first judgeship in Roanoke County in 1893.In 1906, Moffett was elected by legislators to the 20th Judicial Circuit of Virginia, covering the city of Roanoke and Montgomery, Roanoke and Floyd Counties. He was no stranger to contentious cases, and this one promised to be one for the ages.The nine-person grand jury started hearing evidence around 9:30 a.m. Dr. R. Gordon Simmons, the Roanoke coroner who had performed Stockton Heth’s autopsy, testified on the technical details of the death. He was followed by Clement Heth, Dr. Henderson, Deputy Sheriff Camper and the nurse who had helped with the preliminary examination, Emma Garrison.In the courtroom, the defense attorneys — Allen Harless and William Colhoun, assisted by Radford attorney Robert Jordan —were visibly nervous. What if Heth had made another statement before dying besides the one Clement Heth leaked to the press? In a last-ditch effort, Jordan moved to have the grand jury summons quashed on a technicality, but was overruled.Vawter leaned on his chair while clerk George Wilson read the indictment and asked for a plea.Charles Vawter Jr. in the 1917 Bugle yearbook.“Not guilty,” Vawter replied. The Roanoke Times later wrote that the professor, short and roughly 125 pounds, looked “worn and heavily depressed.” Rachel Vawter did not come to the courthouse.The defense counsel tried again to stall the proceedings by objecting to errors in the preparation of the venire facias, the order that assembled a prospective jury. Moffett once again overruled them.Harless and Colhoun, a prominent local team, had been brought in before Vawter posted bail the first time. Harless, born in Montgomery County in 1867, graduated from VAMC in 1885. Like many other local attorneys, he later graduated from the University of Virginia Law School and was admitted to the bar in 1888. He worked as a postmaster in Christiansburg from 1896 to 1906, and later served as mayor of the town for two years between 1914 and 1916.William Colhoun, born in Alleghany Springs in 1871, graduated from Washington and Lee University. He finished his legal education at the University of Virginia as well in 1893 and was admitted to the bar the same year.Harless and Colhoun ran a quite successful firm in Christiansburg, doing everything from corporate law to criminal defense. The Roanoke World News explained how they worked together in a May 9, 1917, story.“Mr. Harless is a man of the distinctly scholarly type—a wonderful combination the firm makes, with Colhoun the orator and the keen cross-examiner, who sees immediately the vital points in a witness’ testimony, and Harless, the student and the deep thinker,” the paper wrote.However, Vawter’s hopes probably laid more in the third attorney — Robert Jordan. Jordan, born in Pulaski in 1863, was the son of Colonel William Jordan, one of the wealthiest citizens in the town. His older brother went on to become the dean of faculty at the University of Tennessee; his younger brother was the treasurer of Pulaski County.Jordan instead went into law. After graduating from Emory and Henry College, he worked for three years as the chief clerk in the U.S. Marshal’s Western District of Virginia office. His work earned him a personal commendation by the U.S. Attorney General.The Montgomery County courthouse in Christiansburg in an undated photograph.Afterward, he went back to school, studying law at the University of Virginia. He was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1895. For 10 years, he served as the commonwealth’s attorney in Radford before entering private practice.In 1917, Jordan was working with the Montgomery County commonwealth’s attorney prosecuting Vawter, Redmond Roop. Their clients including VPI, who they would represent over the summer in litigation against the Western Union telegraph company. It may seem like a conflict of interest when it comes to Vawter’s trial, but there weren’t many lawyers in Montgomery County. Additionally, Jordan had a leg up — he knew how Roop worked.A 1901 profile of Jordan in the Richmond Dispatch described him as “one of the brightest lawyers of the Southwest (Virginia), and an able debater.” It was his skills as an orator that would be the most helpful for Vawter. In 1905, Jordan prosecuted James Linkous, accused of murdering his wife, in a death penalty trial in Radford. His closing argument in that case captivated the audience.“Robert L. Jordan opened for the prosecution and spoke for an hour and a half; no one in the densely packed court room however was conscious of the passage of time. Mr. Jordan spoke in a low, tense voice, which told more plainly than words that a weight of sorrow rested on his heart,” wrote The Evening News of Roanoke in a Jan. 14, 1905, account. “His speech was eloquent, manly, generous and withal so convincing, so powerful an argument against the accused that a plea for the defendant seemed utterly hopeless.”It looked like Charles Vawter was going to need one of those speeches.The front page of the Jan. 14, 1905, issue of The Evening News of Roanoke.Jury selection in the Vawter trial went quicker than expected, unfortunately for the defense, which was still trying to buy time. All but one of the first 16 prospective jurors called were qualified (the 16th was opposed to capital punishment). With the jury selected, court adjourned at 1:15 p.m.Moffett reconvened court at 3 p.m. for the start of the trial. By now, the courthouse had filled with spectators eager to hear more of the juicy details local papers had promised. Redmond Roop, the lead prosecutor working with two attorneys hired by the Heth Family, Jack Lee and Hal Tyler, would start off with his opening statement.Roop, born 1869 in Childress, graduated in 1895 from VAMC with a degree in general science. He wrote the senior class introduction and history for that year’s Bugle yearbook and was the presentation orator for his class’s graduation. His Bugle entry reads that he was known as “Baby,” was a Republican and a Methodist and jokingly believed in the “co-education of the sexes” (VPI was male-only at the time).He shed the nickname “Baby” pretty fast. After graduating from Washington and Lee University in 1898, he went into private practice before being elected commonwealth’s attorney where he was known as “Red Eye.”Roop was already one of the longest-serving commonwealth’s attorneys in Montgomery County. He helped lead the Montgomery County Republican Party and represented the party in several national conventions. His reputation was rock solid.For his opening statement, Roop recounted what Charles Vawter had told the bail commissioner at his second hearing. Rumors had swirled in the presses that Vawter had made a full confession. However, Roop had staunchly refused to release a transcript.The defense objected when Roop began repeating Vawter’s statements. Moffett sent the jury out while the two sides argued. Eventually, Moffett ruled in favor of Roop proceeding.Rachel and Charles Vawter went to see a movie on the evening of Monday, March 12, 1917. After taking their children to bed, the couple headed to a theater rehearsal for an amateur production that Rachel was to take part in.When they returned around 10 p.m., the Vawters found Stockton Heth Jr. at their home. Heth was a regular guest; this was not highly unusual. They invited Heth inside to the parlor, where they played cards along with Bull Williams. At midnight, when the electricity was shut off, they retired.Around 2:30 a.m., Vawter woke up in his bed to discover that his wife was not by his side. Stepping out into the hallway, he saw Rachel run across from Heth’s bedroom into his son’s usual bedroom. His suspicions of infidelity were confirmed.Vawter then went down to his study where he kept his .38-caliber Iver Johnson hammerless pistol. It was loaded with five rounds. While coming back up the steps, Heth confronted Vawter, and Vawter fired three rounds into his abdomen.Roop told the jury that the although the timeline of the shooting was not disputed, the prosecution would prove that Vawter’s motive was false. Vawter would try to claim self-defense, the “unwritten law,” but in fact, Heth had been shot in cold blood.Before closing, Roop reminded the jury not to make any judgement until all evidence had been presented. Although the Roanoke Times did not describe it, it’s easy to imagine Roop giving this warning with a slight smile. Because he did have something that the defense didn’t.A diagram of the second floor of the Vawter house on Virginia Tech’s campus, printed in the Roanoke Times, May 1, 1917.Up next was William Colhoun. Unlike his partner, Allen Harless, the courtroom floor was where he really shone. This statement would shape the course of the trial.Colhoun started off by recalling Charles Vawter’s life, his work and his fairyland marriage to Rachel Henderson. But then, to everyone in the courtroom’s surprise, he admitted that Vawter was an alcoholic — or, as the Roanoke Times would put it in a front-page headline, a “slave to drink.”This was such a scandal because Virginia had gone dry in 1916. National prohibition would follow three years later; public opinion was squarely against the vice of drink. Admitting Vawter was an alcoholic meant admitting to the lesser crime of obtaining alcohol illegally as well as damaging Vawter’s reputation in the jury’s minds.However, the alcoholism was central to the defense’s strategy. According to Colhoun, Heth wormed his way into the Vawters’ lives and used Charles Vawter’s alcoholism “to tempt him, like a serpent.”“Gradually the deceased, by those little attentions, harmless in themselves, most serious when designedly used, so endeared himself to the defendant that he gained his utmost confidence, trust and friendship,” Colhoun told the crowded courtroom. “Having thus engraced himself with the husband, he began his advances to gain the affection and love of the wife.”An undated photograph of a moonshine still.Colhoun laid out Vawter’s version of the relationship. As other residents of Blacksburg had noticed, Stockton Heth had become very close to Rachel Vawter. He would often take her for rides in his car, sometimes without Charles. Charles Vawter bought himself a car even though he couldn’t afford it to try to divert some of that attention.One afternoon in June 1916, Heth called on the Vawters, bringing whiskey with him. Charles Vawter, drunk after several drinks, fell asleep in the parlor, leaving Heth and Rachel alone on the porch. When he woke up around 1 a.m., he went upstairs to see his wife leaving the guest bedroom.Vawter accused his wife and Heth of — well, Colhoun left out the specifics, but you can imagine — which Rachel Vawter denied. Heth was so angry that he grabbed Vawter, who was a much shorter man, and choked him. Somehow, Rachel Vawter and Heth managed to convince Charles Vawter that he was mistaken, and he agreed to overlook the incident.The peace only lasted a few months though. In fall, both Heth and an unnamed married woman were staying at the Vawter residence. Vawter came to suspect that the two were having “improper relations” (as the Roanoke Times put it) and demanded she leave. Heth agreed to take her to Christiansburg in his car.Around Christmas, Heth was once again at the Vawter’s house. If you think you’re noticing a pattern here, you’d be following Colhoun’s logic correctly. Charles Vawter had gone downstairs to attend to the furnace; when he came back, he saw Heth kissing his wife. When Vawter called Heth out, he once again attacked Vawter, choking him “into insensibility,” according to the Roanoke Times.Afterward, the Vawters came to an agreement. Charles Vawter would give up drinking, and Rachel Vawter would never see Heth alone. Heth continued to visit the house when they were both there, but she would leave the house when her husband was teaching classes to avoid Heth.Alumni gather at Finals 1917 on VPI’s campus in spring of that year, around the time of Vawter’s trial.On March 11, Heth returned from Washington, D.C., with a load of whiskey (which was at that point illegal in the state). He was waiting for the Vawters on March 12 at their home when the Vawters returned from the theater. When Charles Vawter said he smelled alcohol, Heth pulled out a flask and suggested they split the contents with Bull Williams.The four of them drank and played cards until midnight, although Colhoun said that Heth poured his drink into Vawter’s empty glass, saying that he “had just had a big one.” At midnight, when the lights cut off, everyone went to their respective bedrooms.Right as the Vawters were about to go to sleep, there was a knock at the bedroom door. Rachel Vawter opened the door to find Heth with a quart and a pint of whiskey as a present. All three of them took nightcaps before retiring.A little before 3 a.m., Charles Vawter woke up to find his wife missing from bed. Hearing voices in the hall, he struck a match and opened the door in time to see his wife running from the guest bedroom into his son’s room.A picture of a similar model of gun to the one used to shoot Stockton Heth with an iPhone 5S for scale.Vawter went to his study downstairs to retrieve his pistol. His wife followed and begged him to give her the gun so that she could kill herself instead. On the way back up, they struggled as she tried to grab the firearm.Then, Heth appeared near the top of the stairway. He went after Vawter, grabbing him by the throat and choking him once again and pushing him against the railing. It was in this struggle, defending his life, that Vawter fired his Iver Johnson three times. Heth fell to the floor.“Charlie Vawter loved Stockton Heth — loved him and treated him as a brother — and then he found that he was a traitor,” Colhoun exclaimed to the courtroom at the climax of his statement.When Colhoun finished, the courtroom was stunned. The only witness the court heard that day was the Roanoke coroner, Dr. Simmons, who testified to some technical details. Colhoun’s opening statement was a hard act to follow.“Certain it is that the case presents elements never encountered in a criminal trial in Virginia before, and that the large crowd in attendance will hear more than one sensation,” the Roanoke Times story on the day’s proceedings read.The front page of the afternoon edition of The Washington Times, May 1, 1917.The second day of the trial of Charles Vawter was scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 2, but was delayed. The prosecution’s second witness, Dr. William Henderson, was working in Blacksburg. The War Department had asked the college physician to examine a squad of VPI students before they left for officers’ training camp at Fort Myer. The country was marching to war, taking VPI students with it.Robert Bermann, writing for The Washington Times, took notes on the Vawter family as they waited for Dr. Henderson to appear. The youthful Rachel Vawter appeared somewhat nervous, fidgeting with her purse. On either side of her sat her children, Rachel and Charles, all three dressed in blue. In the row behind them, Charles Vawter’s sister Leona Vawter and Bull Williams sat together.The Vawters’ son appeared frightened. Charles Vawter kept his arm around him. The younger Rachel’s eyes wandered around the room. At one point, she leaned over to the press table.“Whatcha writing about?” she asked Bermann with a smile.Dr. William Henderson, VPI college physician, in the late 1890s.At 10:25 a.m., Dr. Henderson finally made it to the courtroom. He recalled the events of the night of the murder, from Williams knocking on his door to taking the pistol from Vawter. He identified for the court the pajamas Stockton Heth had been wearing when he was shot. Two bullets had gone through one hole; Dr. Henderson speculated the third had gone through the same hole or a nearby opening.Next, Dr. A. P. Jones, the Jefferson Hospital surgeon who operated on Heth, testified to Heth’s state when he had gone to Blacksburg. When asked by prosecution attorney Jack Lee, Dr. Jones said that it was the shock of the wounds that killed him.Some people in the audience may have come just to see Lee examine and cross-examine witnesses. Born in 1861 in New Orleans, Louisiana, his wealthy parents died when he was 10 years old. He then moved to Virginia, attending Kenmore High School in Amherst and then Sewanee School (now Sewanee: The University of the South). He spent time studying abroad in Germany and attended the University of Virginia.Afterward, Lee passed the bar and served as the Amherst County commonwealth’s attorney from 1886 to 1894. However, Lee ultimately discovered that he preferred to defend, not prosecute. He went into private practice in 1896 and spent most of the rest of his life defending criminals, from a Newport News attorney on trial for shooting the city engineer to a black storekeeper accused of shooting a police officer in Danville.“Mr. Lee was one of the most delightful entertainers in the State, one of the most interesting talkers to be found. He was a profound scholar and philosopher,” read his Nov. 16, 1926, obituary in the Richmond Times-Dispatch.But the Heth family had made Lee change his mind when they asked him to serve as assistant counsel for Roop. For the first time in 20 years, he was going to prosecute and not defend.The final member of the prosecutorial team, Hal Tyler, had little choice to participate — Vawter had shot his cousin. However, he remained quiet as the prosecution presented its case.The Christiansburg train station where most of the participants in the Vawter trial arrived in 1917.Once Lee was finished with Dr. Jones, the prosecution rested. The team had only called two witnesses. From their perspective, things were pretty cut and dry.Defense attorney Robert Jordan called their first witness — Charles Vawter III, the son of the man on trial. The gallery and the press were shocked to see an 11-year-old on the stand. Jordan administered a slightly modified version of the oath.“Charlie,” Jordan asked, “do you know the nature of an oath?”Charlie said yes.“What will happen to a little boy who does not tell the truth?”“He will go to the bad place.”“Who taught you that?”“Mother and father.”On the stand, the boy recounted how he had slept in his little sister’s room the night of the shooting — the family’s dog had messed up his bed. When he heard the shots, he got up, but was told to go back to his room by the adults. It was a shrewd and calculated move by the defense to gain sympathy for the Vawters.Rachel Vawter, her two children and her sister-in-law all left the courtroom once Charlie left the stand. Next up was her husband.Charles Vawter Jr. in the 1914 edition of the Bugle.Vawter testified that he indeed was exceptionally susceptible to alcohol. Only a few drinks would get him quite intoxicated, not surprising considering his small stature. He also told the courtroom that he loved Stockton Heth, “like a brother.” At least, he did before the affair began.He then testified in greater detail to the events his attorney, William Colhoun, had described in his opening statement. In the first incident, when he had fallen asleep drunk in the parlor of his house, Vawter recounted going upstairs when he woke up to see his wife in a night dress running out of Heth’s room. When asked, she said she was just fixing Heth’s collar.Vawter went into Heth’s room and confronted him, telling him, “Stockton, you damn libertine and robber of homes; what do you mean by such conduct with my wife?”Heth then pulled Vawter into his bedroom and, after asking Rachel Vawter to close the door, choked him. Eventually, Vawter’s wife and Heth were able to talk him into believing that he was mistaken.“They could always outtalk me, and their reasons always seemed plausible,” Vawter said on the stand.But Vawter did write a letter, introduced as evidence in court, asking to stay away. Vawter was a prolific letter writer throughout his life; he frequently corresponded with the VPI president, John Eggleston, and other friends. In that particular letter, dated June 15, 1916, Vawter says that his wife had threatened to kill herself and that Heth was a bad influence.June 15, 1916Mr. S. Heth, Jr.,Blacksburg, Va.My Dear Stockton,I have been thinking matters over very carefully and I must ask of you that you do not come to my house or see or write or converse with my wife at all. You may blame me some, but the happiness of our lives has been ruined; and, as I think things over soberly and carefully, I feel that you are not the person for her to associate with. Your influence has been such that only last Sunday she threatened to kill herself. I take any part of the blame, but you should know that no matter what blame may be attached to me, and leaving out the fact that you have no rights, you should have been a friend and helped at a time when she needed help. You seem to forget that what you have done was the worst thing that could be done for her happiness. I trusted you as a friend but I can never trust you again. There are times when a woman needs help and not dragging down. I do not propose to have her pure name dragged in the dust coupled with the very unsavory reputation that you have, so far as the fair sex are concerned.Yours truly,CHARLES E. VAWTER.(as printed in the Roanoke Times, May 2, 1917)However, a second letter introduced from June 22 invites Heth back into the Vawter home. Vawter insinuates that he was worried about his wife’s mental health if the estrangement continued.June 22, 1916Virginia Polytechnic Institute.My Dear Stockton:Please forget a little. I know you can and will. It is certainly no harder for you than for me. I am not going to attempt to write you a letter, but I am going to ask you to give me an opportunity to talk with you some time real soon. I can’t explain in a letter but we would both be glad if you would come and take dinner with us Sunday, or come up some night before.I have been real busy this week with summer school. Have not had a drink since Monday at dinner and that merely an imitation of one. But believe me — I know no one will — I am done with John Barleycorn.Be sure and let me have a chance of talking with you soon and when I ask this I am not thinking of myself but of some whose happiness, if not their life, depends upon it. I have no words of above, for I hope sincerely that my life will lift itself above every obstacle. What with the way — did me this summer and the way my family has done, it is a wonder to me that I am sane and I guess you doubt that.Believe me, I am your sincere friend,C. E. VAWTERPlease drop me a line and let me know that you got this note and that I can see you.(as printed in the Roanoke Times, May 2, 1917)Their friendship continued as strong as ever, even when Vawter suspected Heth of having an affair with the unnamed married woman. He had only broken his promise to abstain from alcohol four times since Christmas.Throughout his testimony, Vawter struggled to keep it together — occasionally breaking out into sobs, according to the Roanoke Times. The past year had been a difficult one; the family was in a bad financial situation as well. Vawter had struck a deal with a publisher to write a physics textbook, hoping that he could finish it by June and then have enough money to keep the advances of wealthy Stockton Heth at bay.To conclude his testimony, he gave his version of the shooting. Early in the morning of March 13, Vawter noticed his wife missing from bed. He struck a match and walked out into the hallway, seeing Rachel Vawter run into his son’s room. Vawter then went downstairs to his study to get his pistol while his wife begged him to shoot her first.According to his testimony, Heth had his hands around Vawter’s neck and had pushed him against the banister when he shot Heth. Heth fell backward onto the floor; Vawter, shocked by what had just happened, retreated to his room.While his wife cared for Heth, giving him a blanket and holding his hand, Vawter went to his children’s room. Rachel was crying after hearing the noise. He took her in his arms and kissed both of his children.“Children, I don’t know what they will do to father, but I have protected you,” he told them. “Whatever happens, be good to mother.”A postcard of the Montgomery County courthouse in Christiansburg, built 1909.Prosecution attorney Jack Lee looked up at the gallery in the courthouse after the court took a lunch break. There were a number of women in attendance.Being the gentleman that he was, he told the courtroom that he was about to ask things that he would not “want his wife or daughter to hear,” according to the Roanoke Times. The defense attorneys concurred. Every woman in the gallery filed out.Lee started his cross-examination of Charles Vawter by delving into more detail the incidents leading up to the shooting. Vawter insisted those had been the only instances of inappropriate conduct.Then, Lee procured a letter and handed it to Vawter, asking him to read it out loud. The audience gasped in shock.My Dear —.Please read this and when you have, destroy it. I can’t speak it for reasons you can guess, but to make my position clear in a matter which I have no control. I know it is my duty to state my positions.It all seems so strange and weird. Then again, I know you will condemn me, but that matters little.I know what happened Sunday afternoon. I was thought to be asleep but in reality I was never more wide awake. I came to the door and found out for myself what I had suspicioned for quite a while. Now I am going to give you the surprise of your life, and I only hope that you will be able to appreciate my position. By a supreme effort I kept my self control that afternoon and can keep it now forever. To make a long matter short I love — beyond what I can express and the conventions of this world cannot make me do anything to mar her happiness. I remember all the years she has had to stick by me when drink made a demon of me, how her love has never faltered. Now mine shall not. I know that you are the only love Rachel has ever known for anyone except me. She loves you dearly and you must not hurt her. Never let her know that I have any idea that she loves you, or that you love her. I hope you do, because if she knew her happiness would be marred. Now you can love her with less fear. You are not worrying me for it is for her happiness, not yours, although I like you very much. You are simply a lucky being.Now I have one favor to ask you to do for me. It will not do (f)or me to ever touch one drop of drink again. I am supremely myself when sober, but quite the reverse when drinking. It would mar all our happiness if I did drink. So this is the favor. I owe to the Roanoke Wine Company $63.00 (my other debts are $2,600). I want you to pay this bill for me when you go to Roanoke on the 25th. Please pay it and tell them to mail me a receipt and from this I will know that you propose to make me one promise and that is all I shall ever ask you and that is that you will not mistreat — I mean by that neglect — my precious sweetheart, and that you will be very careful not to cause her to be talked about or get into any trouble whatsoever.Now you may think me an unprotecting beast of my own but I am not. Love to her comes for few. She cares very little about most people. What right have I to demand that she be my slave and give up all in life that might make her happy? Now don’t feel badly about me. My happiness in life is her happiness. If you can help to make her happy you will help to make me happy.Now we understand each other. I do not blame you in the least. You have taken no advantage of anyone. You are square to the bone and I don’t blame her for loving you one bit. She will love me again some day, for I am going to beat you out by fair means as you, unintentionally, have me.Remember, I like you and love her. That’s all. Don’t worry but above all, DON’T LET HER WORRY.C.I would not ask you to pay the bill if I had the means. If it stands I must order more or pay up. It will not be for me that you pay it, but (f)or her. For me to pay it will be only to deny her.(as printed in the Roanoke Times, May 2, 1917)The letter, found among Stockton Heth’s things after his death, was in an envelope with a bill from the Roanoke Wine and Liquor Company. In it, Vawter acknowledges his wife and Heth are in love. He goes on to say that Heth can continue to see his wife, on one condition: pay his $63 debt at the liquor store.Vawter said he had a faint memory of writing the letter, but he was drunk at the time and the Sunday afternoon incident was a lie. However, Lee introduced more letters and receipts from the liquor store.At one time, Vawter’s tab was as high as $74 ($1,413.65 in 2017 dollars). Heth paid $37.65 of it.The prosecuting attorney did not stop there either. He continued to grill Vawter on the incident involving the married woman. Several times Vawter accidentally used the woman’s name, although newspapers did not repeat it. He had used dashes in place of her name in correspondence, just as he did with Rachel’s name in the letter which had just been introduced, trying to save her reputation.The afternoon session closed with Bull Williams on the stand. He corroborated Vawter’s version of events, adding that the left sleeve of Vawter’s pajamas was torn off during the struggle on March 13 and that he had several scars from the fight on the stairs.Newspapers did not hesitate to condemn Vawter’s apparent moral depravity (at least, depravity in 1917 terms).“Perhaps a board of psychologists could unravel the secrets of Prof. Vawter’s mind as revealed on the witness stand in his own behalf today, but certainly to the people present in the court room, including some of the most eminent lawyers in Virginia, he proved an unsolvable enigma,” a Roanoke Times article written May 2 reads. “It is doubtful if such letters, chief counsel for the prosecution and acknowledged by Vawter as his own, were ever presented in any court. No one pretends to be able to solve them.”That night, a secret meeting of the defense team took place. Vawter’s brother-in-law, Sally Miles, also participated and helped pull together a strategy that they hoped would counteract the serious effect of the new letter introduced that day. It was going to be a long shot.The front page of The World News of Roanoke on May 2, 1917.Moffett reconvened court on May 3 without the fireworks of the previous two days. Williams finished his testimony, describing the wounds that Heth had given Vawter the night of the shooting.The defense team began to set up their new defense, in case self-defense was too hard of a sale. Attorney William Colhoun first called Dr. Alexander Showalter, a Christiansburg doctor, who testified that the recently introduced letter was written by a clinically insane man. The defense also called Dr. Allen Evans of Christiansburg who confirmed Dr. Showalter’s analysis.Lee continued to try to punch holes in that argument, pointing out that there is a difference between being insane and being drunk. Dr. Evans admitted under cross-examination that Vawter’s activity may be explained by “moral degeneracy” as well as insanity.Dr. Henderson also testified for the defense, saying that Vawter was insane. On further questioning from Lee, he also admitted that Vawter was an eccentric man. According to the Roanoke Times, he told the court that on matters outside of physics, “he was, mentally, as a little child.”Charles Vawter Jr. in the 1916 Bugle.At 11:20 a.m., the defense counsel asked for a recess. The courtroom emptied.Both sides met for the next half hour to try to hash out a plea deal. With Lee punching holes in the insanity defense and the letter undermining the self-defense route, Vawter’s attorneys were nervous. On the other hand, the prosecution knew public opinion was in Vawter’s favor and even a strong case might fail in front of a jury. Additionally, rumors swirled that higher-ups on both sides wanted the case resolved quickly.The prosecutors made an offer: Vawter would plead not guilty by reason of insanity, allowing him to be sent to a mental institution where he would be released when authorities determined he was no longer a threat. Rachel Vawter would be spared the witness chair; Charles would be spared the electric chair.Charles Vawter and his attorneys seemed OK with the idea, but his wife was not going to have it.“No, he shall not go to an asylum,” she told the attorneys, according to an anonymous source in the Roanoke Times. “I would rather go on the stand and tell my story, at whatever cost, than to have him suffer more.”A train on the Huckleberry line between Christiansburg and Blacksburg crosses the Virginia Railroad in Merrimac in the 1900s.Meanwhile, in Blacksburg, Sally Miles delivered a letter to VPI President Joseph Eggleston. Eggleston had been a friend of Vawter’s as well; they corresponded regularly, even while Vawter was away during summers working at other locations around the country.The letter Miles delivered to Eggleston was to the point.Vawter had not held class since April 28; the resignation was not unexpected. According to notes Eggleston wrote on the page, Miles told him that Vawter hoped his salary would be paid until Aug. 1 of that year. Eggleston went and asked John Williams, dean of the mathematics department, to fill in the physics chair for the time being.In March, Eggleston had written to assistant professor Frank Robeson, who Vawter had helped hire for the physics department, saying it would “embarrass us seriously” if he did not return. Robeson was away in Maryland at the time; Eggleston offered to promote him to full professor.From left to right: VPI President Joseph Eggleston in an undated photograph and VPI professor of mathematics John Williams in the 1916 Bugle.In Christiansburg, the most anticipated testimony of the entire trial — Rachel Vawter’s — started at 2 p.m. There was not even standing room in the courtroom.The defense made a last-ditch effort to protect Vawter from gossip by asking the judge to clear the spectators. Lee objected and said at least journalists should remain. Moffett, unmoved, said no one would leave.From the stand, Vawter laid out in detail her relationship with Heth. They had been friends for years, but two years ago, Heth’s visits became increasingly frequent.Then, he started plying her with alcohol. She said that whenever she was not drunk, she would refuse to sleep with him. But, he frequently would get her drunk and unable to consent.“Rachel,” Vawter said Heth told her, “nearly all women allow such liberties if you go at them the right way.”In 1917, that was called scandalous behavior. In 2017, that is called rape.Heth already had a bad reputation that he earned while cavorting around the dance halls of Blacksburg and Radford. At the end of one of his letters to Heth, Charles Vawter mentioned “the very unsavory reputation that you have, so far as the fair sex are concerned.” Rachel Vawter may not have been the first woman that he sexually assaulted.To keep up their relationship, even after attacking her husband on multiple occasions, Heth showered her in gifts. In June 1916, Heth offered to give her a pearl necklace and leave behind his automobile for her use. Charles Vawter forbade it and bought a car with his own money, although he couldn’t really afford it.A dance card for the opening German dance given by the VPI German Club in 1917.Rachel Vawter testified that she had heard her daughter coughing on the night of the shooting and gotten up initially to get her medicine, kept near the top of the stairs in the Vawter home. Heth called out to her from his nearby room, “Come in, I want to talk to you.”“I will not,” she replied. Heth grabbed her arm and took her into his room anyway.When she heard her husband coming out of his room, she left Heth’s room for her son’s room. She followed her husband down the stairs as he walked down to his study, confronting him. In the dark, she reached out and could feel the pistol in his hands.“What are you going to do?” she asked.“Go up to the bedroom and I will tell you what I am going to do.”“Give me the pistol and I will kill myself.” Vawter knew what her husband was trying to do.Heth then came out of his room and all three of them struggled on the stairs. According to her testimony, her finger was on the trigger of the Iver Johnson when the shots were fired.This brings up an interesting point about Charles Vawter’s gun, something never brought up in trial. The five-chamber, hammerless .32-caliber pistol had a relatively new feature — a safety trigger. The gun, cheap and widely available, was not known for being powerful or remotely accurate. The velocity of the bullet leaving the gun was too slow to make it a practical weapon outside of close range.However, that safety mechanism would likely have prevented it from firing unless the trigger was pulled. Bumping it was unlikely to cause it to fire. And because the gun was fired at point-blank range, two of the sluggish bullets were still able to pass through Heth’s intestines and into the wall at the top of the stairs.A pole vaulter on what is now the Drillfield with Faculty Row in the background in the 1920s.When Heth fell over in the darkness, she immediately ran to him and called for Bull Williams to bring a candle.“Stockton, whatever happens, remember this is all my fault,” she told him.“No, it is all my fault,” Heth said. He then said he was cold, and Vawter grabbed a blanket from the children’s room for him. The physicians who arrived later said the two were still together, holding hands, when they got there.When Vawter finished, it was time for the cross-examination. Jordan Lee was well known in southwest Virginia as one of the best in the business. The Roanoke Times later called Lee’s drilling of her “the most terrific ordeal that a woman ever went through in court.”Lee first tried to question whether she had sex with Heth before the first choking incident in May 1916, but the defense objected. Judge Moffett sustained. She did however admit under questioning that Heth had told her about the June 15 letter telling him to stay away from the house, and that she had “jumped on” her husband for kicking him out of their house.The prosecuting attorney also tried to introduce the letters for further questioning, but Moffett sustained the defense’s objection to their admission. But Lee had one other avenue of questioning.When asked, Rachel Vawter admitted that on the first night Heth choked Vawter, she had been found naked in Heth’s room. The Roanoke Times, sticking to the predominant sense of morality of the time, declined to print the details of the relationship that came out in court other than to describe them as “horrors of the crime that goaded Vawter to final desperation.”Then, Lee asked about the October incident with the married woman guest, where Charles Vawter supposedly found “signs” that Heth had sex with the guest. Under questioning, Rachel Vawter contradicted her husband’s story.He had been mistaken — the signs were not from the guest. It had been Rachel Vawter who had sex with Heth.The public was in a stupor. The Roanoke Times ran in large type on the front page of its May 3 edition, “MRS. VAWTER BARES LIFE BEFORE JURY TO SAVE HUSBAND.” The details of the conference that could have saved her from testifying were printed just below.According to the Roanoke Times story, after court let out that afternoon, a couple dozen Montgomery County residents were discussing the case outside the courthouse. Someone suggested they poll the group on the outcome of the trial. Every person voted for acquittal.The front page of The World News of Roanoke on May 4, 1917.May 4 was a relatively quiet day for the journalists covering Charles Vawter’s trial. In the morning, the defense called a cashier from the Bank of Blacksburg who told the court Vawter was sober when he saw him around 10 p.m. before the shooting. Another Blacksburg resident testified likewise.The defense then rested.After a 25-minute conference, the prosecution then returned to the court to introduce rebuttal witnesses. Ethel Brown, bookkeeper of the Roanoke Wine and Liquor Company that had relocated to Maryland after the state went dry, identified the company’s ledger book.When asked by Lee, she said that the company filled a number of whiskey orders for Vawter’s brother. A letter from Vawter was introduced from Sept. 14, 1916, asking the company to not fill orders for that name. On cross-examination, Brown admitted they had.The foreman of Whitethorn also testified that he overheard a telephone conversation between Vawter and Heth in January in which Vawter told Heth he could find his wife alone at a friend’s house in Roanoke. Defense attorney William Colhoun attacked him for eavesdropping on his employer.Jersey cows on VPI’s campus in 1895.Another Blacksburg resident testified that it had actually been Bull Williams’ whiskey drunk on the night of the shooting, not Heth’s. He admitted though that he was related to the Tyler and Heth families.The last witness of the morning session was Theodorick Campbell, the dean of faculty at VPI who Heth had called after being shot. He arrived at the Vawter house around 3:25 a.m. the night of the shooting. Once he got there, Williams told him that Heth had already said he had tried to stop Vawter from shooting him.Colhoun cross-examined Campbell, forcing him to admit that he was related to Heth through his wife and considered the dead man like a son. He also admitted that he had talked extensively with the prosecution about the case and would like to see Vawter punished for the death.Campbell also said that Heth had been at his house earlier that night. The dean had invited him to spend the night there, but Heth said that he needed to get home.The defense attorney also attempted to get Campbell to admit he had tried to get Vawter to confess to the crime that night. Campbell denied that was not his intention when he came to the house; he said he had phoned for Sally Miles, Vawter’s brother-in-law, but done nothing else. According to the Roanoke Times, he “regarded (Vawter) as a capable teacher.”The trial was increasingly getting caught up in details and expert witness testimony, which bored the press to a degree. However, the most exciting parts of the trial were yet to come.The Upper Quad in the 1917–18 school year.The Montgomery County sheriff looked up at the gallery balcony right after Judge Moffett called to order the afternoon session of circuit court on Friday, May 4. A large crowd had gathered to watch the proceedings. The balcony was starting to sway under the weight.The sheriff told the judge, who ordered the gallery cleared quickly and quietly for safety’s sake. The proceedings would go without the spectators that had marked the trial to that point.Theodorick Campbell, the VPI dean of faculty who had been grilled in the morning, was re-called. He admitted Bull Williams had told him more than he had said in the morning, and that the two had another conversation about the shooting later when Williams came to his office. But that story changed too — he later admitted to defense attorney William Colhoun that he had sent for Williams to come to his office. He still denied that he asked Vawter for a confession.The prosecution then started introducing doctors to counteract the testimonies of the defense’s witnesses from two days prior. Those doctors had tried to make the case that Charles Vawter had been insane when he wrote the previously introduced scandalous letters about Heth and his wife’s relationship.Jack Lee of the prosecution asked the first doctor, from Radford, if Vawter — assuming that he was conducting his duties as a professor satisfactorily — could have been insane while writing the most unbelievable letter.The defense objected. Vawter had in fact not been performing his job duties. Robert Jordan re-called Vawter himself to the stand, where he said that during when the letter was written (May 1916), he had only one class, which met twice a week for a total of eight times that month.He missed three of those classes. Additionally, he and his wife had heard that students were complaining about his work, although he received no formal reprimand. His family had actually had an intervention for him, consisting of Vawter’s mother, sister and her husband, Sally Miles, during that month.However, the doctor still said that Vawter was sane. Another two doctors from Radford and Dr. W. W. Rangeley from Christiansburg also testified that Vawter likely was sane throughout the last year. Colhoun still managed to poke holes in their diagnoses though, riffing on the thin line between what he described as “degeneracy” and insanity.The front page of The World News of Roanoke from May 5, 1917.On Saturday morning, the 16 members of the jury and the judge for the trial of Vawter’s took a trip in open-top automobiles to Blacksburg. Along with the sheriff and two deputies, they were going to the scene of the crime — the home of Charles Vawter.Several journalists accompanied the party on its excursion. A staff correspondent for the Roanoke Times noted the eerie nature of the home where Stockton Heth had been killed. A fire had been kindled in the fireplace to warm up the jurors. On Vawter’s desk in the study, a thin layer of dust covered the physics textbook he had been writing when Heth was shot.While jurors went upstairs, the Times correspondent stepped into the dining room. There, Charles Vawter was discussing the sale of a piece of mahogany furniture with another journalist. As the Times correspondent and Vawter walked out of the room, Vawter picked up a small wrench from a table.“This is all I have left of my car,” Vawter told the reporter. “I sold it last week.”Upstairs, the locations of the bullets lodged in the wall of the home were measured. One was just shy of five feet off the floor; another was just over six inches. The two were a little bit under a foot apart. It appeared that Vawter had shot Heth in a struggle; otherwise, it seemed unlikely they could have been spread out so far and still gone through Heth.An automobile at VPI in the 1920s.The court reconvened in Christiansburg at 11:15 a.m. A VPI student presented a drawing of where the bullets had been found for the courtroom, after which the prosecution rested, although the defense had allowed them to call more witnesses later.The defense called a farmer that insinuated the Whitethorn farm manager had fabricated his testimony the previous day, based on a story he had told him about an argument he witnessed between Charles and Rachel Vawter.Charles Vawter and Bull Williams were also re-called, contradicting Campbell’s claim that he did not ask Vawter for a confession after the shooting. They both said that Campbell said, “Professor Vawter, I am an older man than you are. If you have anything to say you had better say it to me.”The defense tried to shore up that argument with six character witnesses, ranging from professors to liverymen, who said that Williams was trustworthy.The defense also called Sally Miles who testified that he had indeed participated in Vawter’s intervention last May. Over the objection of the prosecution, he also recounted what Williams had told him that Heth had said after being shot. He had gone into Williams’ room to ask about the shooting after arriving at the house, called there by Campbell. Another VPI student who had come to the home after hearing about it said he heard some of that conversation and could corroborate it.The defense also recalled one of the prosecution’s doctors from the previous day, Dr. Rangeley of Christiansburg. Apparently, he had been first asked by the defense to testify whether Vawter was sane, though he did not tell the attorneys at the time if he was sane or not. Miles was also re-called — he said that Dr. Rangeley had told him the night after the letter was first introduced in court that Vawter was insane. Dr. Rangeley returned to the stand to say that he hadn’t read the letter at that point.The trial seemed to be heading for a conclusion; the court did not reconvene on Sunday. However, the participants increasingly earned the contempt of the public. A Roanoke Times account called Vawter either a “a weak and pitiful wreck of the damning demon of drink” or “a fiend in human form.”VPI cadets on Miles Field in the 1920s.On Monday, May 7, Judge Moffett chose to convene court in the Wilmont Theatre, the only movie theater in town. The theater was an odd place to hold court, but it was the only adequately sized building in the area, and there were lingering concerns that the courthouse might have been irreparably damaged by the large crowds. At the entrance, posters advertised the silent films that were playing: “An Oily Scoundrel,” “Zaza” and “Martha’s Indication.” The Roanoke Times reporter thought that some of those titles were serendipitous.Some of the seats from the floor were relocated to the stage for the jury to sit in. Judge Moffett traded his chair in the courthouse for a cane-bottomed seat. The stage lights kept the juror’s faces bathed in an eerie colored glow. Journalists were relegated to the orchestra loft, where they sat among the drums and piano.Dr. J. K. Hall testified at length for the defense about the nature of alcoholic insanity. Dr. Hall was the superintendent of the Westbrook Sanatorium in Richmond, one of the largest addiction rehabilitation centers in the South at the time. He was quite clear about Vawter’s mental state.“Alcohol preserves what is put into it and destroys what it is put into,” Dr. Hall told the court, quoting what he said was an old Scottish proverb.A second doctor, this one from Roanoke, was questioned by Allen Harless from the defense (which is only the least bit interesting because Harless was considered the bookish one on the team). Jack Lee was unable to shake either of the doctor’s insistence that alcohol consumption leads to insanity, which manifested itself in the form of the letters which confounded the courtroom in 1917.Around 2:30 p.m., the court moved back to the courthouse. It was determined that it was safe as long as the gallery was not used. Two more doctors were called by the prosecution, though their credentials were shaky — one, Dr. J. C. King admitted he rarely saw insane patients in practice and the other was related to the Tyler and Heth families (King had recently opened a new sanatorium in Radford in Heth’s old high school).After the testimony, both sides rested. Moffett and the attorneys retired to chambers to work out the details of jury instructions and the order of closing statements.An advertisement for the silent film “Zaza,” starring Pauline Frederick.Tuesday, May 8, was the second day of rain and cold in Christiansburg. It was a perfect day for nearby farmers to go to the courthouse and hear what promised to be a dramatic closing act — the closing arguments of the defense and prosecuting attorneys.Robert Jordan started off for the defense. He had a heavy weight on his shoulders; his team was all that stood between Charles Vawter and the electric chair. Luckily, this is where Jordan shone.Jordan told the jury that he had prayed to God so that he might speak the truth. In detail, he recounted the moments after Vawter had shot Stockton Heth, when he went into his children’s room and gathered them in his arms. One or two members of the jury were already starting to cry.He then recounted Rachel Vawter’s testimony and attacked the prosecution, particularly for their desperate attempts to find doctors to rebut the defense’s assertions that Vawter was insane. Most of the speech he dedicated to the infamous letter where Vawter appears to trade his wife for his liquor bill in Roanoke.Jordan worked with trademark sarcasm and wit. He reminded the jury that Edgar Allan Poe probably had written “The Raven” while in a drunken frenzy. Not one to mince words, he also reminded the jury of Dr. William Henderson’s description of Vawter as having the mind of a child. Heth and Rachel Vawter had conspired against the man on trial and “molded as the potter molds his clay.”In the next day’s account in the paper, the journalist described how the “jury broke down and cried like babies — a scene never witnessed in the experience of seasoned newspaper men who have reported some of the most sensational criminal cases in the country.”“(Heth) enjoyed the fruits of his bargain without even meeting its terms, either as to the pecuniary consideration or the first article of the agreement, which was that he was to destroy the letter as soon as read! Why did he want to keep it? Was he proud of the kind of bargain he could drive?” Jordan shouted to the jury, according to the Roanoke Times, while attacking Heth.In his opening statement, commonwealth’s attorney Redmond Roop had said the defense would come with a bucket of whitewash for Vawter’s reputation and a bucket of tar for Heth’s. Jordan told the jury he didn’t need tar. Roop had brought it for him, in the form of the famous letter.After recounting the final moments of when Heth was shot, Jordan reminded the jury of the words of Jesus in the Bible to a crowd that is about to stone a woman accused of adultery — “Let him that is without sin among you cast the first stone.”Several of the jurors at this point had pulled out their handkerchiefs and buried their faces in them. The entire courtroom, according to a Roanoke Times account, was deeply moved. Judge Moffett saw that the jury was in no condition to proceed. He asked the sheriff to take the jury outside for 10 or 15 minutes to let them compose themselves.A staff correspondent for the Roanoke Times called Jordan’s speech “masterly.” In the next day’s account in the paper, the journalist described how the “jury broke down and cried like babies — a scene never witnessed in the experience of seasoned newspaper men who have reported some of the most sensational criminal cases in the country.”Faculty Row and the Extension Building on VPI’s campus in 1916.The remaining closing arguments by the attorneys failed to live up to Robert Jordan’s fireworks. Allen Harless provided a second closing argument to the defense, making less of an emotional and more of a logical appeal, followed by William Colhoun. Redmond Roop made the first closing argument for the prosecution, arguing it was Vawter’s questionable morality that led to Heth’s premature death. Roop also made a biblical reference — his to Joseph’s temptation by the wife of Pharaoh’s chief captain in the Book of Genesis — but his did not leave the jury in tears.Court reconvened on the afternoon of May 9, a rainless day that had a more seasonable, spring-like feel. Jack Lee, the renowned attorney brought in to help the prosecution, delivered a two-and-a-half-hour long speech that attempted to rival Jordan’s eloquence. Things were still uncertain when the jury retired to deliberate at 4:35 p.m.Twenty minutes into deliberations, the jury asked for the letters and Charles Vawter’s torn nightshirt as evidence. Discussion continued until 7 p.m.In the courtroom, the other attorneys had gone home, leaving only Robert Jordan with Charles Vawter in the courthouse. Some reporters and a handful of spectators remained when it was announced that the jury was ready. The deputy clerk read the decision to the courtroom.“We, the jury, find the defendant, Charles E. Vawter, not guilty as charged in the within indictment.”Vawter jumped out of his chair and hugged his 69-year-old mother, who had sat by him and waited for the verdict since most of his family had gone to Blacksburg. “Oh glory!” she shouted to the courtroom. Jordan, sitting in his chair at the table, lifted his hand to the sky and said, “Thank God!” before beginning to cry.One of the reporters still in the courthouse found a telephone and called Rachel Vawter, who was at home in Blacksburg with the children. She was overjoyed with the news but told the journalist that she couldn’t make a statement — she needed to tell Charlie and Rachel that daddy was coming home.Evidently, the trial had never even been close in the minds of the jury. An unnamed member of it told the Roanoke Times that it had been decided in a single ballot. They would have accepted either theory of the defense — both insanity and self-defense appeared to apply.When Charles Vawter returned to Blacksburg, a number of his friends and neighbors came by to congratulate him. According to the Roanoke Times, it appeared that the residents of Blacksburg by and large approved of the verdict.Before he headed home that night, a member of the jury told a Roanoke Times reporter how futile Roop and Lee’s efforts had been. Their minds had been made up before the trial even started.The front page of the Richmond Times-Dispatch from May 10, 1917.The trial was over and Vawter was freed, but the saga was not over, especially not for VPI. The school was already in tough shape as many students and alumni marched off to fight in Europe. At least 42 percent of all alumni of VPI fought in the war — 28 were killed in battle or died in camps. In April, the school had become a training for the Army and Navy to help with the war effort.Meanwhile, VPI President Joseph Eggleston had a public relations nightmare on his hands. The Vawter trial had received attention throughout the country in no small part due to Charles Vawter’s position as the head of the physics department. Editorials appeared throughout the country damning the loose morals apparently rampant in Blacksburg.“The conduct of Heth and the Vawters, and perhaps one or two of their associates, became a subject of comment and gossip in the Blacksburg community and beyond,” wrote the Bristol Herald-Courier in a May 10, 1917, editorial. A clipping from the story was found among Eggleston’s papers. “Why, under the circumstances, Vawter was retained on the faculty of the college, and permitted to maintain a residence on the college campus, is a mystery which those responsible for the management of the institution will have to explain.”Eggleston helped lead the campaign to scrub the stain of Vawter and Heth from the university. The rector of the local episcopal church and VPI chaplain, R. B. Nelson, wrote to a number of friends in Baltimore, Maryland, asking for their support.“It is simply incredible that a whole community should be so damned unheard. Yet this is exactly what has been done by some of the editorials which have come to my notice,” Nelson wrote in one letter, dated May 8, 1917. He implored his friends to reach out to the Baltimore papers to try to quiet the storm.For the most part, Eggleston’s efforts worked. The trial of Vawter is not mentioned in the university’s historical digest, a detailed history of the school. It never appeared in The Virginia Tech, the Collegiate Times’ predecessor.In spring 1919, Eggleston surprised the school by announcing he would resign at the end of the term. He later took the job of president at Hampden-Sydney College. His work in Blacksburg was done.A night view of Broad Street in Philadelphia, circa 1916.Charles and Rachel Vawter also had to leave Blacksburg after Vawter’s resignation. In June, Charles Vawter wrote to Eggleston to settle the situation of his house on Faculty Row. The university wanted to charge Vawter $1,000 due to smoke damage in the house (in an attempt to unfreeze pipes in winter, he had set a fire in a grate in the servant’s closet).Vawter’s next letters to Eggleston found him heading north to New York in search of employment. Eggleston agreed to write a letter of reference for Vawter when he applied to the Queen-Gray Company, a scientific instrument company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In his letter of reference, Eggleston skipped over the reasons for Vawter’s departure and called him “a teacher of unusual ability” and “gifted in his line of work.” He did not get the job.On July 28, Vawter wrote to Eggleston that he had found a job — his boss had “never heard of me till I met him by appointment,” but had taken him on nonetheless without recommendation. Vawter did ask Eggleston that his last salary payment come soon; his insurance was due on Aug. 5.Vawter eventually managed to find steady work. It was in the years after leaving VPI that he invented most of his devices for a handful of different companies, gaining quite a reputation for his more than 200 creations. According to an Associated Press obituary, he retired around 1921 to focus on his experiments.Although Vawter had managed to find a job, it was a tough several years for the family. Vawter’s mother, Virginia Longley, died June 5, 1918, in Roanoke and was buried alongside her husband at the Miller School that he had helped found. Charles Vawter III died Sept. 4, 1925, also while living in Roanoke, and was buried in Blacksburg beside his uncle, Edmund Vawter, who had died in 1912.Rachel, the Vawters’ daughter, married legendary VPI coach Henry “Puss” Redd, a 1921 graduate who served in France in World War I. Redd, known as “Big Bear,” lost only one game to Alabama University in his first year as head coach in 1932 (and it was only a 9–6 loss, to boot).Many years later, in 1997, an endowment fund was established in Redd’s name by an anonymous donor to recognize his later work as alumni secretary for the school. The fund has been used to acquire and preserve materials in the university’s Special Collections, indirectly helping the writing of this story.In 1931, Rachel and Charles were living in the Germantown area of northwest Philadelphia. On May 19, Vawter was working on a new ignition system for airplanes alone in his home laboratory.He was lubricating a motor when a spark set the oil alight. An explosion covered Vawter’s clothes in flaming oil. Rachel, hearing the commotion, wrapped him in a bed quilt in a futile attempt to smother the flame and burned her hands badly in the process.His final appearance in the press was his obituary, which was printed in the New York Times and Chicago Tribune. Charles Vawter died about 24 hours later on May 20, 1931.The story of the Vawters and Heth is notable for a number of reasons. For one, it features some of the most prominent people in Virginia Tech history. Charles Vawter Sr., Joseph Eggleston, Sally Miles, Theodorick Campbell and Frank Robeson all have buildings named after them on Virginia Tech’s campus.Another reason is that it had a profound, though subtle, impact on the future of the university. After Stockton Heth Sr. and Clement Heth died in 1927 and 1930 respectively, Whitethorn was slowly sold off to the university, Blacksburg and Radford, allowing a new age of development.The media frenzy surrounding the trial is curious too, given the fact that journalists are still fascinated by scandalous cases like that of the Vawter’s. The timing is also notable — as VPI students were marching off to fight for their lives in Europe, Vawter was standing in a courtroom in a small town in Virginia, begging for his.Reading about the scandalous affairs of Stockton Heth Jr. and Charles Vawter were a form of escapism for a war-weary country. Accounts of the trial made it in print all across the country, from New York to Arizona. For one week in May, Vawter’s name would appear next to those of Kaiser Wilhelm II and Vladimir Lenin.The case is also remarkable because it touches on a number of themes still relevant today. Stockton Heth Jr. sexually assaulted Rachel Vawter by her own account, using alcohol to take advantage of her. The scenes may have changed, but the problem remains the same.According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, 11.2 percent of undergraduate and graduate students have experienced rape or sexual assault. About 23 percent of female undergraduate students experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or incapacitation, just like what Rachel Vawter described in that courtroom in 1917.Twenty percent of female students between the ages of 18 and 24 who are victims will report their experience to law enforcement. Vawter’s testimony in court was an exception and a rare glimpse into something that people did not talk about in 1917 (and rarely do today). However, today we do have some resources — if you are sexually assaulted, you do have options; the Virginia Tech Police Department recommends visiting stopabuse.vt.edu to learn more.The Roanoke Times had called it “one of the most remarkable cases in the history of Virginia” — and that was before Vawter was even charged with the murder. It has all the elements of a good crime novel, down to the very ending, a crime novel that seems a little bit too real.Editor in Chief

Clement Heth looked down at his brother, Stockton Heth Jr., in his bed at Roanokeâ€™s Jefferson Hospital. By him stood Redmond Roop, commonwealthâ€™s attorney for Montgomery County, and Dr. A. P. Jones, the attending physician.Clement took shorthand notes that he would later give to the Roanoke Times. Dr. Jones had told him these might be his brother's last words. Roop had been summoned earlier that night, taking the train up from Christiansburg.â€śLet me go to sleep, Clem,â€ť Stockton replied, â€śand then, Iâ€™ll tell you all about it.â€ťâ€śIâ€™m afraid that if you go to sleep, youâ€™ll never wake up.â€ťStocktonâ€™s intestines were punctured in five places, and another bullet had pierced one of his kidneys.

He died at 4:55 a.m.Looking south on Jefferson Street in Roanoke in 1918.Charles Erastus Vawter Jr. was born in 1877, the son of Charles Erastus Vawter Sr. and Virginia Longley. The senior Vawter served in the Confederate Armyâ€™s Stonewall Brigade as a captain before being captured in the last months of the war.He went on to graduate from Emory and Henry College in 1866, the same year he married Longley. He did some coursework at the University of Virginia before working as a mathematics professor at his alma mater for a decade. In 1878, he left to help found the Miller Manual Labor School in Albemarle, Virginia, where he stayed until his death in 1905.In 1886, Virginia Gov. Fitzhugh Lee asked Vawter to ply his organizational skills at the floundering Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (VAMC) in Blacksburg â€” the school that would become Virginia Tech. He served as rector of the Board of Visitors until 1900, helping to turn the college around and setting it on track to become the major university it is today. Vawter Hall, a residence hall on Techâ€™s campus, is named after him.Charles Vawter Jr. in the 1913 Bugle yearbook.His son, however, does not have a building named after him. After attending the Miller School, Charles Vawter Jr. enrolled at the University of Virginia. He graduated in 1898 with majors in math and physics. Immediately afterward, Charles Vawter Jr. found a position at VPI, the new name of VAMC. We are left to speculate if his father might have pulled a few strings to arrange that.In 1898, the math and physics departments merged, allowing Vawter to hold the title of Acting Professor of Mathematics and Physics (the acting was dropped after a probationary first year). This arrangement continued until 1900, when the departments once again split and Vawter became the chair of the physics department.Vawter also took after his fatherâ€™s love of technology and machinery. In 1883, Charles Vawter Sr. installed an Edison dynamo at the Miller School, making it one of the first schools in the south to install electric lights.Charles Vawter Jr. was a quite brilliant inventor, actually. In 1905, he filed a patent for a device that would record output from devices such as a voltmeter on paper. Over his lifetime, he would invent more than 200 radio and electrical devices. His patents included a pneumatic tire, a rail bond tester, a fuel gauge for motor vehicles, an electrical impedance meter â€” the list is too long to put here.William Tams Jr., a 1902 graduate of VPI, later recalled that Vawter was â€śclever and well likedâ€ť and paid for the football teamâ€™s train tickets to go to away games. In 1903, he published a book based on lectures he attended at Londonâ€™s Central Technical College, and the 1913 Bugle yearbook was dedicated to him.â€śA son and a grandson of professors, high intellectuality is a marked characteristic of (Vawterâ€™s) mentality,â€ť wrote Theodorick Campbell, then a professor of modern languages, in the yearbook. â€śIn character he is honest, truthful, and conscientious in the discharge of his duties, as well as in other relations of life.â€ťCampbell would not always hold Vawter in such high regard. Especially not after he shot one of his best friends.Science Hall, the home of the VPI physics department, in 1918.Rachel Henderson was born in 1882 to Thomas Henderson and Polly McConkey, and would grow up at the center of Salemâ€™s burgeoning society scene.She attended Salem High School, where she was a regular feature on the schoolâ€™s honor roll. In addition to her good grades, she was very active in the schoolâ€™s literary societies. And, of course, she was quite popular with the boys. The Roanoke Times would later say she was â€śone of the most beautiful women in Virginia.â€ťBy all accounts, she also was a bit of a traditionalist, settling into the acceptable routine for a wealthy young lady at the time. In her junior year at Salem High School, the Roanoke Daily Times recounted a debate she participated in, put on by the literary societies. Henderson and her partner argued that â€śwomen should be censured for bicycle riding.â€ť The judges found the opposing teamâ€™s argument more convincing.After graduating in 1897, Henderson organized parties, attended dances and made appearances in the society pages of the Salem Times-Register and Roanoke Times. In particular, she went to or hosted a number of balls at Roanoke College or the Salem Cotillion Club. She never had the same partner twice in newspaper accounts.An undated photograph of Rachel Henderson that appeared in the May 1, 1917, edition of the Roanoke Times.Henderson also visited Blacksburg quite frequently. Her uncle, Dr. William Henderson, had been one of the first VAMC students and came back in 1891 as the college physician. In 1902, he helped establish the college infirmary in what is now Henderson Hall. For many years, he was a fixture in the Blacksburg community, chaperoning dances, attending football games and making house calls.Perhaps Henderson met Vawter when she visited Blacksburg in June 1900. If not then, maybe when she spent a month there in 1901, or during a stay with her uncle in April 1902.Vawter also made a visit to Salem in June 1902 that was publicized in the Richmond Dispatchâ€™s society pages. It is quite possible that the June visit was to propose. Henderson attended her last dance as Ms. Rachel Henderson at the Salem-Roanoke German Club on June 10, 1902, in the company of Dr. G. E. Koontz.On Aug. 20, Vawter and Henderson announced their wedding in the Richmond Dispatch, which wrote that the â€śwedding promises to be one of Salemâ€™s most fashionable society events.â€ť The paper noted that Henderson â€śhas been noted both at home and abroad for her beauty and charm of person.â€ť Vawter was called â€śa young man of great ability and popularity.â€ťThe two were wed Sept. 3, 1902, at 9 p.m. (night owls, I guess) in the Salem Presbyterian Church, decorated with palms that reminded the Dispatch of â€śfairyland.â€ť A reception was held that night at the Hendersonâ€™s home on Main Street in Salem before they headed off on their honeymoon in Niagara Falls, New York.The Vawter home in 1917, as printed in the Roanoke Times.The Vawters returned to Blacksburg later that month to a warm welcome. Hundreds of VPI cadets gave the Vawters a calathump in early October in commemoration of the marriage, beating tin pans and blowing horns outside Hendersonâ€™s house. The citizens of Blacksburg were not pleased.The couple eventually took up residence in a house on Faculty Row, located on campus on the north side of what is now the Drillfield. Their first house was located approximately where McBryde Hall is now. In 1915, that home was torn down to make way for a new building, and the family moved to a house located near what is now the east end of Pamplin Hall.The Vawters had two children: Charles Erastus Vawter III in 1906 and Rachel Henderson Vawter around 1908. They lived what appeared to be quite a happy life. Charles Vawter was an active Mason, Rachel Henderson continued to chaperone dances and the couple remained quite visible on the Blacksburg social scene.A map of campus in 1915.If Rachel Vawterâ€™s romantic endeavors seem odd when compared to her background, then Stockton Heth Jr. was the man you might have expected her to marry. Heth was born in 1879 to Stockton Heth Sr. and Isabella Hammett, one of the most â€” if not the most â€” prominent families in Montgomery County (yes, Heth as in Hethwood Apartment Homes).The senior Heth was born in 1839 and fought as a captain in the Confederate Army before marrying Hammett in October 1867. Hammett had grown up in Radford and inherited the estate on which the eastern part of Radford is built.Heth was the president of the Exchange Bank of Radford and, after the marriage, one of the largest landowners in the county. Property he owned, including a stretch of woods known as Heth Grove, became the location of the State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Radford. That school is known today as Radford University. Hethâ€™s old home was used as a residence hall, and Heth Hall on campus is named for the family.In 1889, when Stockton Heth Jr. was 10, his family purchased Whitethorn, the farm of the late James Francis Preston. The family spent many summers on the 1,500-acre estate that stretched for miles between Blacksburg and Radford.Stockton Heth Jr. stood 6 feet tall and weighed nearly 200 pounds, quite imposing for the time. After graduating from St. Albans Lutheran School for Boys in Radford (which is now a paranormal attraction), Heth really didnâ€™t do much. His job was technically to run Whitethorn, but letâ€™s be honest â€” that was not his real focus.An undated portrait of James Hoge Tyler, governor of Virginia and Stockton Heth Jr.â€™s uncle.Heth instead kept himself in local society pages, attending dances and events. He did raise horses; one of his, Bohemian Gray, placed in several competitions.On his motherâ€™s side, his aunt was married to James Hoge Tyler, governor of Virginia from 1898 to 1902. Stockton Heth Jr. was frequently mentioned in society pages as a visitor of his. After Tyler underwent surgery in Roanoke in 1911, The Evening News of Roanoke reported that Heth drove him to his home, Halwyck, in his new â€śeasy riding car.â€ťWhen Heth wasnâ€™t hosting dances and events, he was in attendance. He became a frequent visitor of the VPI German Club, showing up to midwinter, Easter and Thanksgiving dances for many years, either stag or with a new girl. He was known for his flirtatious behavior.â€śHethâ€™s marked affections to married women in the past have been the cause of considerable criticism and it is understood that in social circles, he has been the object of rebuke,â€ť the Roanoke Times wrote after his death.In the years leading up to 1917, people had begun to notice that Rachel Vawter and Heth had gotten quite close. Heth was a frequent visitor to the Vawter home in Blacksburg and had been seen driving about with Rachel Vawter in his automobile. However, this all appeared to be with Charles Vawterâ€™s consent and little was thought of it.Of course, that was until March 13, 1917.Ellettâ€™s Drugstore and the post office in Blacksburg, 1910.Dr. William Hendersonâ€™s phone rang around 2:45 a.m. on March 13. It was Charles Vawter. Stockton Heth had been shot in his home; the doctor better come quickly. Right as Vawter was finishing, Dr. Hendersonâ€™s doorbell rang.On his doorstep was Bernard â€śBullâ€ť Williams, a senior at VPI studying agriculture. A regular German Club attendee, he rented a room from the Vawters. His 1917 Bugle entry described him as â€śever ready to assist in time of troubleâ€ť and that the authors had â€śnever seen him angry.â€ťâ€śFor Godâ€™s sake, come at once!â€ť Williams told Dr. Henderson, as he would later recount in court.While Dr. Henderson headed toward the Vawtersâ€™ house, Williams ran to get another Blacksburg doctor, Dr. T. B. Ellett.They arrived at about the same time and went inside the home. On the second floor of the house at the top of the main stairs, they found Heth lying in his pajamas with a blanket draped over his body. He was still conscious. Rachel Vawter was nearby; her husband was in their bedroom.(From left to right) Theodorick Campbell, dean of VPI faculty, in the 1917 Bugle yearbook; Clarence â€śSallyâ€ť Miles, Charles Vawter Jr.â€™s brother-in-law and former VPI football coach, in the 1915 Bugle yearbook; and Bernard "Bull" Williams in the 1917 Bugle yearbook.After administering an anesthetic, Heth asked the doctors to call Theodorick Campbell, a close friend of his. Dr. Henderson used Vawterâ€™s phone to call Campbell, who was the dean of faculty at VPI. Campbell, after hearing the news, also called Clarence â€śSallyâ€ť Miles, who was Vawterâ€™s brother-in-law, a VPI professor and a former football coach. Miles had led VPI to its first football victory over the University of Virginia; the schoolâ€™s football field and track at the time was named after him.The doctors then went into the bedroom where Charles Vawter was and asked him to hand over the pistol used. Vawter went to a dresser and withdrew the gun, a .32-caliber Iver Johnson revolver. Three of its five cartridges had been fired.Heth was driven down the street from the Vawterâ€™s house to the college infirmary, now Henderson Hall, for further examination. A nurse, Emma Garrison, was on hand to help. There were three bullet wounds in his lower left abdomen: at least two of the bullets appeared to have gone through the same entry wound. One appeared to still be lodged in Hethâ€™s body.The doctors would need to operate immediately. The holes in Hethâ€™s intestines meant that their contents could spill out, increasing the risk of a dangerous infection. Today, the death rate for penetrating abdominal trauma such as a bullet wound is about five percent at a comprehensive trauma center, according to Medscape.But letâ€™s think about it â€” the college infirmary in 1917 fell way short of that. The infirmary had been the college presidentâ€™s house before being converted in 1902. And, before World War I, abdominal gunshot wounds were nearly always fatal, no matter who treated it or where it was treated.Dr. William Henderson in the VPI infirmary during the 1902â€“03 academic year.They also summoned Dr. A. P. Jones, one of the few surgeons in the area who worked at Jefferson Hospital in Roanoke. He came down as soon as possible to help. When he arrived, Heth was still conscious and answering questions intelligibly, a good sign.Heth was taken on the No. 17 Norfolk and Western train to Roanoke, where an ambulance was waiting. Dr. Jones, Dr. Henderson and another doctor started surgery shortly after noon, about nine hours after Heth had been found in the Vawterâ€™s home. The single bullet in Hethâ€™s abdomen was removed and the other wounds were stitched during the two-hour surgery.Meanwhile, Hethâ€™s relatives began to converge on the hospital. Lt. Clement Heth was stationed with the Army at Fort Hunt near Washington, D.C., and came down after he received a telegram. His sisters, Virginia and Sally Heth, also in D.C. at the time, came down too. However, his father was in California â€” it would take days to cross the country.For the first 24 hours after the operation, it seemed as though Heth might pull through. However, by 9 p.m. on March 14, it was apparent that the early optimism had been mislaid. Although Dr. Jones would say in court that the â€śshockâ€ť of the wound had killed Heth, it was more likely an infection. Virginia and Sally Heth spent most of the night beside the patientâ€™s bed.When it became apparent that he would not survive, the Heth family placed a long-distance call to commonwealthâ€™s attorney Redmond Roop of Montgomery County. Roop had gone to the Vawter home to collect evidence earlier that day, although little of note was found. As required by law, Roop came as soon as he could to Roanoke to take Hethâ€™s dying statement.Heth died at 4:55 a.m. on March 15, 1917. His body was turned over to undertaker John Oakey. His siblings made the sad trek back to Radford, where Hethâ€™s mother was buried in the family cemetery four years prior. His father did not arrive until March 17.Main Street and the railroad yards in Radford in 1897.Although the doctors acted fairly quickly, law enforcement did not. That was probably because in all of the hullabaloo, nobody thought to â€” or maybe no one wanted to â€” call the sheriff. The college marshal had been summoned, but Heth was on his way to Roanoke before a warrant was issued.The first Deputy Sheriff C. M. Camper heard of it was after 8 a.m. on March 13, over five hours after Charles Vawter called Dr. Henderson. The justice of the peace, W. R. Stanger, heard about the shooting when his niece phoned him to see if he had any information around 10 a.m. Stanger contacted Camper and afterward issued a warrant for Charles Vawterâ€™s arrest.State of Virginia,County of Montgomery, to-wit:To the Sheriff of said County:Whereas, C. M. Camper has this day made complaint and information on oath before me, W. R. Stranger, a justice of the peace in and for said county, that on or before the 13th day of March, 1917, in the said county, Prof. C. E. Vawter did unlawfully, feloniously and maliciously, with a certain dangerous and deadly weapon, towit: pistol, loaded with gunpowder and leaden bullets, shoot, wound, kill, and murder Stockton Heth, Jr.These are, therefore, in the name of the Commonwealth of Virginia to command and bring before me or some other justice of the peace of the said county, the body of the said Prof. C. E. Vawter to answer said complaint and to be further dealt with according to law.And moreover upon the arrest of the said C. E. Vawter by virtue of this warrant, I command you in the name of the Commonwealth of Virginia to summon Dr. W. F. Henderson, Dr. T. B. Elliott, and Bernard Williams to appear at the time and place of this warrant as witnesses to testify in behalf of the Commonwealth against the said C. E. Vawter, that is to say, on the next day following the day of arrest, and have then and there these witnesses and this warrant with your return thereon.Given under my hand this 15th day of March, 1917.W. R. STANGER, J.(as printed in The World News of Roanoke, March 16, 1917)Vawter called Camper after hearing about the warrant and asked to meet him at the afternoon train on the Huckleberry line to Christiansburg, where he would post bail. He did indeed show up, along with two other VPI faculty: Miles and William Brodie, an associate professor of mathematics and a 1901 graduate of VPI.In Christiansburg, the bail commissioner released him on a $1,000 bond, paid by Miles and Brodie. Vawterâ€™s attorneys, Allen Harless and William Colhoun of the Christiansburg firm Harless and Colhoun helped secure his release. Vawter was back in Blacksburg a free man before 7 p.m. that night.When Heth died, Stanger drew up a new warrant for Vawterâ€™s arrest.Vawter once again appeared before the bail commissioner the day after Hethâ€™s death, this time accompanied by Camper; Miles; Colonel Sidney Sheltman, a wealthy Montgomery County citizen; and Charles Wade, the vice president of the Bank of Christiansburg. The three posted Vawterâ€™s $10,000 bond, allowing him to return to Blacksburg that afternoon. Later that day, a Roanoke Times reporter saw him walking with his wife on campus.The Huckleberry depot in Blacksburg, taken around 1912â€“13.The news of the shooting made it to the press on March 14. Next to front page stories about a major railroad strike and the fighting on the Western front in Europe, the Richmond Times-Dispatch ran â€śMystery shrouds shooting of Heth.â€ťThe stories were light on detail and heavy on speculation; Vawter refused to talk to the press. He went to his house where his wife was waiting, and the Roanoke Times said that they continued to see visitors, although they refused to talk about the shooting.After his arraignment for murder, Vawterâ€™s counsel released a statement to satiate the press. Reporters had been chomping at the bit since Clement Heth recounted to a Roanoke Times reporter his brotherâ€™s last words.â€śIn view of the account published by the press of what is purported to be the dying statement of Stockton Heth, Jr., as to the circumstances leading up to his shooting, counsel for Professor C. E. Vawter, of the opinion that it would serve no good purpose for their client to make any detailed statement at this time other than to say that after a thorough investigation of the surrounding facts culminating in the unfortunate tragedy, the evidence will disclose a betrayal of friendship and confidence reposed. The day has not come when the honor of a Virginia home is no longer assured and we feel that our client will have nothing to fear at the hands of a jury of his countrymen.â€ť(statement by Harless and Colhoun to the press, as printed by the Roanoke Times)When the attorneys announced that the cause of the shooting was a â€śbetrayal of friendship,â€ť the press immediately latched on. Stories were already circulating about the closeness of Heth and Rachel Vawter â€” it was supposed that the trial would hinge around her â€śhonor.â€ť The news of the defense strategy appeared in papers from The Washington Times of Washington, D.C., (â€śHome sanctity plea advanced in Heth killingâ€ť) to The Tacoma Times of Tacoma, Washington, (â€śProfessor will plead the â€?unwritten lawâ€™â€ť).It was not that the newspapers were exceptionally desperate for content. On March 15, Czar Nicholas II of Russia abdicated, setting the stage for the Soviet takeover of the country (The World News of Roanoke declared it the â€śmost orderly revolution (the) world has ever witnessedâ€ť). It was just that the thought of the beautiful wife of a brilliant professor cheating on her husband was too salacious to resist.The newspapers and public would have to wait until May, when the trial was scheduled to begin, to find out more.The front page of the World News of Roanoke, March 16, 1917.The May 1917 term of the Montgomery County Circuit Court, held by Judge William Moffett, convened at 9 a.m. on May 1, 1917. The first item on the docket: the murder trial of Charles Vawter Jr.Moffett, born 1854 in Culpeper County, was admitted to the bar in 1877. He had been elected to the Virginia State Legislature and worked as an attorney in Washington, D.C., before he was appointed to his first judgeship in Roanoke County in 1893.In 1906, Moffett was elected by legislators to the 20th Judicial Circuit of Virginia, covering the city of Roanoke and Montgomery, Roanoke and Floyd Counties. He was no stranger to contentious cases, and this one promised to be one for the ages.The nine-person grand jury started hearing evidence around 9:30 a.m. Dr. R. Gordon Simmons, the Roanoke coroner who had performed Stockton Hethâ€™s autopsy, testified on the technical details of the death. He was followed by Clement Heth, Dr. Henderson, Deputy Sheriff Camper and the nurse who had helped with the preliminary examination, Emma Garrison.In the courtroom, the defense attorneys â€” Allen Harless and William Colhoun, assisted by Radford attorney Robert Jordan â€”were visibly nervous. What if Heth had made another statement before dying besides the one Clement Heth leaked to the press? In a last-ditch effort, Jordan moved to have the grand jury summons quashed on a technicality, but was overruled.Vawter leaned on his chair while clerk George Wilson read the indictment and asked for a plea.Charles Vawter Jr. in the 1917 Bugle yearbook.â€śNot guilty,â€ť Vawter replied. The Roanoke Times later wrote that the professor, short and roughly 125 pounds, looked â€śworn and heavily depressed.â€ť Rachel Vawter did not come to the courthouse.The defense counsel tried again to stall the proceedings by objecting to errors in the preparation of the venire facias, the order that assembled a prospective jury. Moffett once again overruled them.Harless and Colhoun, a prominent local team, had been brought in before Vawter posted bail the first time. Harless, born in Montgomery County in 1867, graduated from VAMC in 1885. Like many other local attorneys, he later graduated from the University of Virginia Law School and was admitted to the bar in 1888. He worked as a postmaster in Christiansburg from 1896 to 1906, and later served as mayor of the town for two years between 1914 and 1916.William Colhoun, born in Alleghany Springs in 1871, graduated from Washington and Lee University. He finished his legal education at the University of Virginia as well in 1893 and was admitted to the bar the same year.Harless and Colhoun ran a quite successful firm in Christiansburg, doing everything from corporate law to criminal defense. The Roanoke World News explained how they worked together in a May 9, 1917, story.â€śMr. Harless is a man of the distinctly scholarly typeâ€”a wonderful combination the firm makes, with Colhoun the orator and the keen cross-examiner, who sees immediately the vital points in a witnessâ€™ testimony, and Harless, the student and the deep thinker,â€ť the paper wrote.However, Vawterâ€™s hopes probably laid more in the third attorney â€” Robert Jordan. Jordan, born in Pulaski in 1863, was the son of Colonel William Jordan, one of the wealthiest citizens in the town. His older brother went on to become the dean of faculty at the University of Tennessee; his younger brother was the treasurer of Pulaski County.Jordan instead went into law. After graduating from Emory and Henry College, he worked for three years as the chief clerk in the U.S. Marshalâ€™s Western District of Virginia office. His work earned him a personal commendation by the U.S. Attorney General.The Montgomery County courthouse in Christiansburg in an undated photograph.Afterward, he went back to school, studying law at the University of Virginia. He was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1895. For 10 years, he served as the commonwealthâ€™s attorney in Radford before entering private practice.In 1917, Jordan was working with the Montgomery County commonwealthâ€™s attorney prosecuting Vawter, Redmond Roop. Their clients including VPI, who they would represent over the summer in litigation against the Western Union telegraph company. It may seem like a conflict of interest when it comes to Vawterâ€™s trial, but there werenâ€™t many lawyers in Montgomery County. Additionally, Jordan had a leg up â€” he knew how Roop worked.A 1901 profile of Jordan in the Richmond Dispatch described him as â€śone of the brightest lawyers of the Southwest (Virginia), and an able debater.â€ť It was his skills as an orator that would be the most helpful for Vawter. In 1905, Jordan prosecuted James Linkous, accused of murdering his wife, in a death penalty trial in Radford. His closing argument in that case captivated the audience.â€śRobert L. Jordan opened for the prosecution and spoke for an hour and a half; no one in the densely packed court room however was conscious of the passage of time. Mr. Jordan spoke in a low, tense voice, which told more plainly than words that a weight of sorrow rested on his heart,â€ť wrote The Evening News of Roanoke in a Jan. 14, 1905, account. â€śHis speech was eloquent, manly, generous and withal so convincing, so powerful an argument against the accused that a plea for the defendant seemed utterly hopeless.â€ťIt looked like Charles Vawter was going to need one of those speeches.The front page of the Jan. 14, 1905, issue of The Evening News of Roanoke.Jury selection in the Vawter trial went quicker than expected, unfortunately for the defense, which was still trying to buy time. All but one of the first 16 prospective jurors called were qualified (the 16th was opposed to capital punishment). With the jury selected, court adjourned at 1:15 p.m.Moffett reconvened court at 3 p.m. for the start of the trial. By now, the courthouse had filled with spectators eager to hear more of the juicy details local papers had promised. Redmond Roop, the lead prosecutor working with two attorneys hired by the Heth Family, Jack Lee and Hal Tyler, would start off with his opening statement.Roop, born 1869 in Childress, graduated in 1895 from VAMC with a degree in general science. He wrote the senior class introduction and history for that yearâ€™s Bugle yearbook and was the presentation orator for his classâ€™s graduation. His Bugle entry reads that he was known as â€śBaby,â€ť was a Republican and a Methodist and jokingly believed in the â€śco-education of the sexesâ€ť (VPI was male-only at the time).He shed the nickname â€śBabyâ€ť pretty fast. After graduating from Washington and Lee University in 1898, he went into private practice before being elected commonwealthâ€™s attorney where he was known as â€śRed Eye.â€ťRoop was already one of the longest-serving commonwealthâ€™s attorneys in Montgomery County. He helped lead the Montgomery County Republican Party and represented the party in several national conventions. His reputation was rock solid.For his opening statement, Roop recounted what Charles Vawter had told the bail commissioner at his second hearing. Rumors had swirled in the presses that Vawter had made a full confession. However, Roop had staunchly refused to release a transcript.The defense objected when Roop began repeating Vawterâ€™s statements. Moffett sent the jury out while the two sides argued. Eventually, Moffett ruled in favor of Roop proceeding.Rachel and Charles Vawter went to see a movie on the evening of Monday, March 12, 1917. After taking their children to bed, the couple headed to a theater rehearsal for an amateur production that Rachel was to take part in.When they returned around 10 p.m., the Vawters found Stockton Heth Jr. at their home. Heth was a regular guest; this was not highly unusual. They invited Heth inside to the parlor, where they played cards along with Bull Williams. At midnight, when the electricity was shut off, they retired.Around 2:30 a.m., Vawter woke up in his bed to discover that his wife was not by his side. Stepping out into the hallway, he saw Rachel run across from Hethâ€™s bedroom into his sonâ€™s usual bedroom. His suspicions of infidelity were confirmed.Vawter then went down to his study where he kept his .38-caliber Iver Johnson hammerless pistol. It was loaded with five rounds. While coming back up the steps, Heth confronted Vawter, and Vawter fired three rounds into his abdomen.Roop told the jury that the although the timeline of the shooting was not disputed, the prosecution would prove that Vawterâ€™s motive was false. Vawter would try to claim self-defense, the â€śunwritten law,â€ť but in fact, Heth had been shot in cold blood.Before closing, Roop reminded the jury not to make any judgement until all evidence had been presented. Although the Roanoke Times did not describe it, itâ€™s easy to imagine Roop giving this warning with a slight smile. Because he did have something that the defense didnâ€™t.A diagram of the second floor of the Vawter house on Virginia Techâ€™s campus, printed in the Roanoke Times, May 1, 1917.Up next was William Colhoun. Unlike his partner, Allen Harless, the courtroom floor was where he really shone. This statement would shape the course of the trial.Colhoun started off by recalling Charles Vawterâ€™s life, his work and his fairyland marriage to Rachel Henderson. But then, to everyone in the courtroomâ€™s surprise, he admitted that Vawter was an alcoholic â€” or, as the Roanoke Times would put it in a front-page headline, a â€śslave to drink.â€ťThis was such a scandal because Virginia had gone dry in 1916. National prohibition would follow three years later; public opinion was squarely against the vice of drink. Admitting Vawter was an alcoholic meant admitting to the lesser crime of obtaining alcohol illegally as well as damaging Vawterâ€™s reputation in the juryâ€™s minds.However, the alcoholism was central to the defenseâ€™s strategy. According to Colhoun, Heth wormed his way into the Vawtersâ€™ lives and used Charles Vawterâ€™s alcoholism â€śto tempt him, like a serpent.â€ťâ€śGradually the deceased, by those little attentions, harmless in themselves, most serious when designedly used, so endeared himself to the defendant that he gained his utmost confidence, trust and friendship,â€ť Colhoun told the crowded courtroom. â€śHaving thus engraced himself with the husband, he began his advances to gain the affection and love of the wife.â€ťAn undated photograph of a moonshine still.Colhoun laid out Vawterâ€™s version of the relationship. As other residents of Blacksburg had noticed, Stockton Heth had become very close to Rachel Vawter. He would often take her for rides in his car, sometimes without Charles. Charles Vawter bought himself a car even though he couldnâ€™t afford it to try to divert some of that attention.One afternoon in June 1916, Heth called on the Vawters, bringing whiskey with him. Charles Vawter, drunk after several drinks, fell asleep in the parlor, leaving Heth and Rachel alone on the porch. When he woke up around 1 a.m., he went upstairs to see his wife leaving the guest bedroom.Vawter accused his wife and Heth of â€” well, Colhoun left out the specifics, but you can imagine â€” which Rachel Vawter denied. Heth was so angry that he grabbed Vawter, who was a much shorter man, and choked him. Somehow, Rachel Vawter and Heth managed to convince Charles Vawter that he was mistaken, and he agreed to overlook the incident.The peace only lasted a few months though. In fall, both Heth and an unnamed married woman were staying at the Vawter residence. Vawter came to suspect that the two were having â€śimproper relationsâ€ť (as the Roanoke Times put it) and demanded she leave. Heth agreed to take her to Christiansburg in his car.Around Christmas, Heth was once again at the Vawterâ€™s house. If you think youâ€™re noticing a pattern here, youâ€™d be following Colhounâ€™s logic correctly. Charles Vawter had gone downstairs to attend to the furnace; when he came back, he saw Heth kissing his wife. When Vawter called Heth out, he once again attacked Vawter, choking him â€śinto insensibility,â€ť according to the Roanoke Times.Afterward, the Vawters came to an agreement. Charles Vawter would give up drinking, and Rachel Vawter would never see Heth alone. Heth continued to visit the house when they were both there, but she would leave the house when her husband was teaching classes to avoid Heth.Alumni gather at Finals 1917 on VPIâ€™s campus in spring of that year, around the time of Vawterâ€™s trial.On March 11, Heth returned from Washington, D.C., with a load of whiskey (which was at that point illegal in the state). He was waiting for the Vawters on March 12 at their home when the Vawters returned from the theater. When Charles Vawter said he smelled alcohol, Heth pulled out a flask and suggested they split the contents with Bull Williams.The four of them drank and played cards until midnight, although Colhoun said that Heth poured his drink into Vawterâ€™s empty glass, saying that he â€śhad just had a big one.â€ť At midnight, when the lights cut off, everyone went to their respective bedrooms.Right as the Vawters were about to go to sleep, there was a knock at the bedroom door. Rachel Vawter opened the door to find Heth with a quart and a pint of whiskey as a present. All three of them took nightcaps before retiring.A little before 3 a.m., Charles Vawter woke up to find his wife missing from bed. Hearing voices in the hall, he struck a match and opened the door in time to see his wife running from the guest bedroom into his sonâ€™s room.A picture of a similar model of gun to the one used to shoot Stockton Heth with an iPhone 5S for scale.Vawter went to his study downstairs to retrieve his pistol. His wife followed and begged him to give her the gun so that she could kill herself instead. On the way back up, they struggled as she tried to grab the firearm.Then, Heth appeared near the top of the stairway. He went after Vawter, grabbing him by the throat and choking him once again and pushing him against the railing. It was in this struggle, defending his life, that Vawter fired his Iver Johnson three times. Heth fell to the floor.â€śCharlie Vawter loved Stockton Heth â€” loved him and treated him as a brother â€” and then he found that he was a traitor,â€ť Colhoun exclaimed to the courtroom at the climax of his statement.When Colhoun finished, the courtroom was stunned. The only witness the court heard that day was the Roanoke coroner, Dr. Simmons, who testified to some technical details. Colhounâ€™s opening statement was a hard act to follow.â€śCertain it is that the case presents elements never encountered in a criminal trial in Virginia before, and that the large crowd in attendance will hear more than one sensation,â€ť the Roanoke Times story on the dayâ€™s proceedings read.The front page of the afternoon edition of The Washington Times, May 1, 1917.The second day of the trial of Charles Vawter was scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 2, but was delayed. The prosecutionâ€™s second witness, Dr. William Henderson, was working in Blacksburg. The War Department had asked the college physician to examine a squad of VPI students before they left for officersâ€™ training camp at Fort Myer. The country was marching to war, taking VPI students with it.Robert Bermann, writing for The Washington Times, took notes on the Vawter family as they waited for Dr. Henderson to appear. The youthful Rachel Vawter appeared somewhat nervous, fidgeting with her purse. On either side of her sat her children, Rachel and Charles, all three dressed in blue. In the row behind them, Charles Vawterâ€™s sister Leona Vawter and Bull Williams sat together.The Vawtersâ€™ son appeared frightened. Charles Vawter kept his arm around him. The younger Rachelâ€™s eyes wandered around the room. At one point, she leaned over to the press table.â€śWhatcha writing about?â€ť she asked Bermann with a smile.Dr. William Henderson, VPI college physician, in the late 1890s.At 10:25 a.m., Dr. Henderson finally made it to the courtroom. He recalled the events of the night of the murder, from Williams knocking on his door to taking the pistol from Vawter. He identified for the court the pajamas Stockton Heth had been wearing when he was shot. Two bullets had gone through one hole; Dr. Henderson speculated the third had gone through the same hole or a nearby opening.Next, Dr. A. P. Jones, the Jefferson Hospital surgeon who operated on Heth, testified to Hethâ€™s state when he had gone to Blacksburg. When asked by prosecution attorney Jack Lee, Dr. Jones said that it was the shock of the wounds that killed him.Some people in the audience may have come just to see Lee examine and cross-examine witnesses. Born in 1861 in New Orleans, Louisiana, his wealthy parents died when he was 10 years old. He then moved to Virginia, attending Kenmore High School in Amherst and then Sewanee School (now Sewanee: The University of the South). He spent time studying abroad in Germany and attended the University of Virginia.Afterward, Lee passed the bar and served as the Amherst County commonwealthâ€™s attorney from 1886 to 1894. However, Lee ultimately discovered that he preferred to defend, not prosecute. He went into private practice in 1896 and spent most of the rest of his life defending criminals, from a Newport News attorney on trial for shooting the city engineer to a black storekeeper accused of shooting a police officer in Danville.â€śMr. Lee was one of the most delightful entertainers in the State, one of the most interesting talkers to be found. He was a profound scholar and philosopher,â€ť read his Nov. 16, 1926, obituary in the Richmond Times-Dispatch.But the Heth family had made Lee change his mind when they asked him to serve as assistant counsel for Roop. For the first time in 20 years, he was going to prosecute and not defend.The final member of the prosecutorial team, Hal Tyler, had little choice to participate â€” Vawter had shot his cousin. However, he remained quiet as the prosecution presented its case.The Christiansburg train station where most of the participants in the Vawter trial arrived in 1917.Once Lee was finished with Dr. Jones, the prosecution rested. The team had only called two witnesses. From their perspective, things were pretty cut and dry.Defense attorney Robert Jordan called their first witness â€” Charles Vawter III, the son of the man on trial. The gallery and the press were shocked to see an 11-year-old on the stand. Jordan administered a slightly modified version of the oath.â€śCharlie,â€ť Jordan asked, â€śdo you know the nature of an oath?â€ťCharlie said yes.â€śWhat will happen to a little boy who does not tell the truth?â€ťâ€śHe will go to the bad place.â€ťâ€śWho taught you that?â€ťâ€śMother and father.â€ťOn the stand, the boy recounted how he had slept in his little sisterâ€™s room the night of the shooting â€” the familyâ€™s dog had messed up his bed. When he heard the shots, he got up, but was told to go back to his room by the adults. It was a shrewd and calculated move by the defense to gain sympathy for the Vawters.Rachel Vawter, her two children and her sister-in-law all left the courtroom once Charlie left the stand. Next up was her husband.Charles Vawter Jr. in the 1914 edition of the Bugle.Vawter testified that he indeed was exceptionally susceptible to alcohol. Only a few drinks would get him quite intoxicated, not surprising considering his small stature. He also told the courtroom that he loved Stockton Heth, â€ślike a brother.â€ť At least, he did before the affair began.He then testified in greater detail to the events his attorney, William Colhoun, had described in his opening statement. In the first incident, when he had fallen asleep drunk in the parlor of his house, Vawter recounted going upstairs when he woke up to see his wife in a night dress running out of Hethâ€™s room. When asked, she said she was just fixing Hethâ€™s collar.Vawter went into Hethâ€™s room and confronted him, telling him, â€śStockton, you damn libertine and robber of homes; what do you mean by such conduct with my wife?â€ťHeth then pulled Vawter into his bedroom and, after asking Rachel Vawter to close the door, choked him. Eventually, Vawterâ€™s wife and Heth were able to talk him into believing that he was mistaken.â€śThey could always outtalk me, and their reasons always seemed plausible,â€ť Vawter said on the stand.But Vawter did write a letter, introduced as evidence in court, asking to stay away. Vawter was a prolific letter writer throughout his life; he frequently corresponded with the VPI president, John Eggleston, and other friends. In that particular letter, dated June 15, 1916, Vawter says that his wife had threatened to kill herself and that Heth was a bad influence.June 15, 1916Mr. S. Heth, Jr.,Blacksburg, Va.My Dear Stockton,I have been thinking matters over very carefully and I must ask of you that you do not come to my house or see or write or converse with my wife at all. You may blame me some, but the happiness of our lives has been ruined; and, as I think things over soberly and carefully, I feel that you are not the person for her to associate with. Your influence has been such that only last Sunday she threatened to kill herself. I take any part of the blame, but you should know that no matter what blame may be attached to me, and leaving out the fact that you have no rights, you should have been a friend and helped at a time when she needed help. You seem to forget that what you have done was the worst thing that could be done for her happiness. I trusted you as a friend but I can never trust you again. There are times when a woman needs help and not dragging down. I do not propose to have her pure name dragged in the dust coupled with the very unsavory reputation that you have, so far as the fair sex are concerned.Yours truly,CHARLES E. VAWTER.(as printed in the Roanoke Times, May 2, 1917)However, a second letter introduced from June 22 invites Heth back into the Vawter home. Vawter insinuates that he was worried about his wifeâ€™s mental health if the estrangement continued.June 22, 1916Virginia Polytechnic Institute.My Dear Stockton:Please forget a little. I know you can and will. It is certainly no harder for you than for me. I am not going to attempt to write you a letter, but I am going to ask you to give me an opportunity to talk with you some time real soon. I canâ€™t explain in a letter but we would both be glad if you would come and take dinner with us Sunday, or come up some night before.I have been real busy this week with summer school. Have not had a drink since Monday at dinner and that merely an imitation of one. But believe me â€” I know no one will â€” I am done with John Barleycorn.Be sure and let me have a chance of talking with you soon and when I ask this I am not thinking of myself but of some whose happiness, if not their life, depends upon it. I have no words of above, for I hope sincerely that my life will lift itself above every obstacle. What with the way â€” did me this summer and the way my family has done, it is a wonder to me that I am sane and I guess you doubt that.Believe me, I am your sincere friend,C. E. VAWTERPlease drop me a line and let me know that you got this note and that I can see you.(as printed in the Roanoke Times, May 2, 1917)Their friendship continued as strong as ever, even when Vawter suspected Heth of having an affair with the unnamed married woman. He had only broken his promise to abstain from alcohol four times since Christmas.Throughout his testimony, Vawter struggled to keep it together â€” occasionally breaking out into sobs, according to the Roanoke Times. The past year had been a difficult one; the family was in a bad financial situation as well. Vawter had struck a deal with a publisher to write a physics textbook, hoping that he could finish it by June and then have enough money to keep the advances of wealthy Stockton Heth at bay.To conclude his testimony, he gave his version of the shooting. Early in the morning of March 13, Vawter noticed his wife missing from bed. He struck a match and walked out into the hallway, seeing Rachel Vawter run into his sonâ€™s room. Vawter then went downstairs to his study to get his pistol while his wife begged him to shoot her first.According to his testimony, Heth had his hands around Vawterâ€™s neck and had pushed him against the banister when he shot Heth. Heth fell backward onto the floor; Vawter, shocked by what had just happened, retreated to his room.While his wife cared for Heth, giving him a blanket and holding his hand, Vawter went to his childrenâ€™s room. Rachel was crying after hearing the noise. He took her in his arms and kissed both of his children.â€śChildren, I donâ€™t know what they will do to father, but I have protected you,â€ť he told them. â€śWhatever happens, be good to mother.â€ťA postcard of the Montgomery County courthouse in Christiansburg, built 1909.Prosecution attorney Jack Lee looked up at the gallery in the courthouse after the court took a lunch break. There were a number of women in attendance.Being the gentleman that he was, he told the courtroom that he was about to ask things that he would not â€śwant his wife or daughter to hear,â€ť according to the Roanoke Times. The defense attorneys concurred. Every woman in the gallery filed out.Lee started his cross-examination of Charles Vawter by delving into more detail the incidents leading up to the shooting. Vawter insisted those had been the only instances of inappropriate conduct.Then, Lee procured a letter and handed it to Vawter, asking him to read it out loud. The audience gasped in shock.My Dear â€”.Please read this and when you have, destroy it. I canâ€™t speak it for reasons you can guess, but to make my position clear in a matter which I have no control. I know it is my duty to state my positions.It all seems so strange and weird. Then again, I know you will condemn me, but that matters little.I know what happened Sunday afternoon. I was thought to be asleep but in reality I was never more wide awake. I came to the door and found out for myself what I had suspicioned for quite a while. Now I am going to give you the surprise of your life, and I only hope that you will be able to appreciate my position. By a supreme effort I kept my self control that afternoon and can keep it now forever. To make a long matter short I love â€” beyond what I can express and the conventions of this world cannot make me do anything to mar her happiness. I remember all the years she has had to stick by me when drink made a demon of me, how her love has never faltered. Now mine shall not. I know that you are the only love Rachel has ever known for anyone except me. She loves you dearly and you must not hurt her. Never let her know that I have any idea that she loves you, or that you love her. I hope you do, because if she knew her happiness would be marred. Now you can love her with less fear. You are not worrying me for it is for her happiness, not yours, although I like you very much. You are simply a lucky being.Now I have one favor to ask you to do for me. It will not do (f)or me to ever touch one drop of drink again. I am supremely myself when sober, but quite the reverse when drinking. It would mar all our happiness if I did drink. So this is the favor. I owe to the Roanoke Wine Company $63.00 (my other debts are $2,600). I want you to pay this bill for me when you go to Roanoke on the 25th. Please pay it and tell them to mail me a receipt and from this I will know that you propose to make me one promise and that is all I shall ever ask you and that is that you will not mistreat â€” I mean by that neglect â€” my precious sweetheart, and that you will be very careful not to cause her to be talked about or get into any trouble whatsoever.Now you may think me an unprotecting beast of my own but I am not. Love to her comes for few. She cares very little about most people. What right have I to demand that she be my slave and give up all in life that might make her happy? Now donâ€™t feel badly about me. My happiness in life is her happiness. If you can help to make her happy you will help to make me happy.Now we understand each other. I do not blame you in the least. You have taken no advantage of anyone. You are square to the bone and I donâ€™t blame her for loving you one bit. She will love me again some day, for I am going to beat you out by fair means as you, unintentionally, have me.Remember, I like you and love her. Thatâ€™s all. Donâ€™t worry but above all, DONâ€™T LET HER WORRY.C.I would not ask you to pay the bill if I had the means. If it stands I must order more or pay up. It will not be for me that you pay it, but (f)or her. For me to pay it will be only to deny her.(as printed in the Roanoke Times, May 2, 1917)The letter, found among Stockton Hethâ€™s things after his death, was in an envelope with a bill from the Roanoke Wine and Liquor Company. In it, Vawter acknowledges his wife and Heth are in love. He goes on to say that Heth can continue to see his wife, on one condition: pay his $63 debt at the liquor store.Vawter said he had a faint memory of writing the letter, but he was drunk at the time and the Sunday afternoon incident was a lie. However, Lee introduced more letters and receipts from the liquor store.At one time, Vawterâ€™s tab was as high as $74 ($1,413.65 in 2017 dollars). Heth paid $37.65 of it.The prosecuting attorney did not stop there either. He continued to grill Vawter on the incident involving the married woman. Several times Vawter accidentally used the womanâ€™s name, although newspapers did not repeat it. He had used dashes in place of her name in correspondence, just as he did with Rachelâ€™s name in the letter which had just been introduced, trying to save her reputation.The afternoon session closed with Bull Williams on the stand. He corroborated Vawterâ€™s version of events, adding that the left sleeve of Vawterâ€™s pajamas was torn off during the struggle on March 13 and that he had several scars from the fight on the stairs.Newspapers did not hesitate to condemn Vawterâ€™s apparent moral depravity (at least, depravity in 1917 terms).â€śPerhaps a board of psychologists could unravel the secrets of Prof. Vawterâ€™s mind as revealed on the witness stand in his own behalf today, but certainly to the people present in the court room, including some of the most eminent lawyers in Virginia, he proved an unsolvable enigma,â€ť a Roanoke Times article written May 2 reads. â€śIt is doubtful if such letters, chief counsel for the prosecution and acknowledged by Vawter as his own, were ever presented in any court. No one pretends to be able to solve them.â€ťThat night, a secret meeting of the defense team took place. Vawterâ€™s brother-in-law, Sally Miles, also participated and helped pull together a strategy that they hoped would counteract the serious effect of the new letter introduced that day. It was going to be a long shot.The front page of The World News of Roanoke on May 2, 1917.Moffett reconvened court on May 3 without the fireworks of the previous two days. Williams finished his testimony, describing the wounds that Heth had given Vawter the night of the shooting.The defense team began to set up their new defense, in case self-defense was too hard of a sale. Attorney William Colhoun first called Dr. Alexander Showalter, a Christiansburg doctor, who testified that the recently introduced letter was written by a clinically insane man. The defense also called Dr. Allen Evans of Christiansburg who confirmed Dr. Showalterâ€™s analysis.Lee continued to try to punch holes in that argument, pointing out that there is a difference between being insane and being drunk. Dr. Evans admitted under cross-examination that Vawterâ€™s activity may be explained by â€śmoral degeneracyâ€ť as well as insanity.Dr. Henderson also testified for the defense, saying that Vawter was insane. On further questioning from Lee, he also admitted that Vawter was an eccentric man. According to the Roanoke Times, he told the court that on matters outside of physics, â€śhe was, mentally, as a little child.â€ťCharles Vawter Jr. in the 1916 Bugle.At 11:20 a.m., the defense counsel asked for a recess. The courtroom emptied.Both sides met for the next half hour to try to hash out a plea deal. With Lee punching holes in the insanity defense and the letter undermining the self-defense route, Vawterâ€™s attorneys were nervous. On the other hand, the prosecution knew public opinion was in Vawterâ€™s favor and even a strong case might fail in front of a jury. Additionally, rumors swirled that higher-ups on both sides wanted the case resolved quickly.The prosecutors made an offer: Vawter would plead not guilty by reason of insanity, allowing him to be sent to a mental institution where he would be released when authorities determined he was no longer a threat. Rachel Vawter would be spared the witness chair; Charles would be spared the electric chair.Charles Vawter and his attorneys seemed OK with the idea, but his wife was not going to have it.â€śNo, he shall not go to an asylum,â€ť she told the attorneys, according to an anonymous source in the Roanoke Times. â€śI would rather go on the stand and tell my story, at whatever cost, than to have him suffer more.â€ťA train on the Huckleberry line between Christiansburg and Blacksburg crosses the Virginia Railroad in Merrimac in the 1900s.Meanwhile, in Blacksburg, Sally Miles delivered a letter to VPI President Joseph Eggleston. Eggleston had been a friend of Vawterâ€™s as well; they corresponded regularly, even while Vawter was away during summers working at other locations around the country.The letter Miles delivered to Eggleston was to the point.Vawter had not held class since April 28; the resignation was not unexpected. According to notes Eggleston wrote on the page, Miles told him that Vawter hoped his salary would be paid until Aug. 1 of that year. Eggleston went and asked John Williams, dean of the mathematics department, to fill in the physics chair for the time being.In March, Eggleston had written to assistant professor Frank Robeson, who Vawter had helped hire for the physics department, saying it would â€śembarrass us seriouslyâ€ť if he did not return. Robeson was away in Maryland at the time; Eggleston offered to promote him to full professor.From left to right: VPI President Joseph Eggleston in an undated photograph and VPI professor of mathematics John Williams in the 1916 Bugle.In Christiansburg, the most anticipated testimony of the entire trial â€” Rachel Vawterâ€™s â€” started at 2 p.m. There was not even standing room in the courtroom.The defense made a last-ditch effort to protect Vawter from gossip by asking the judge to clear the spectators. Lee objected and said at least journalists should remain. Moffett, unmoved, said no one would leave.From the stand, Vawter laid out in detail her relationship with Heth. They had been friends for years, but two years ago, Hethâ€™s visits became increasingly frequent.Then, he started plying her with alcohol. She said that whenever she was not drunk, she would refuse to sleep with him. But, he frequently would get her drunk and unable to consent.â€śRachel,â€ť Vawter said Heth told her, â€śnearly all women allow such liberties if you go at them the right way.â€ťIn 1917, that was called scandalous behavior. In 2017, that is called rape.Heth already had a bad reputation that he earned while cavorting around the dance halls of Blacksburg and Radford. At the end of one of his letters to Heth, Charles Vawter mentioned â€śthe very unsavory reputation that you have, so far as the fair sex are concerned.â€ť Rachel Vawter may not have been the first woman that he sexually assaulted.To keep up their relationship, even after attacking her husband on multiple occasions, Heth showered her in gifts. In June 1916, Heth offered to give her a pearl necklace and leave behind his automobile for her use. Charles Vawter forbade it and bought a car with his own money, although he couldnâ€™t really afford it.A dance card for the opening German dance given by the VPI German Club in 1917.Rachel Vawter testified that she had heard her daughter coughing on the night of the shooting and gotten up initially to get her medicine, kept near the top of the stairs in the Vawter home. Heth called out to her from his nearby room, â€śCome in, I want to talk to you.â€ťâ€śI will not,â€ť she replied. Heth grabbed her arm and took her into his room anyway.When she heard her husband coming out of his room, she left Hethâ€™s room for her sonâ€™s room. She followed her husband down the stairs as he walked down to his study, confronting him. In the dark, she reached out and could feel the pistol in his hands.â€śWhat are you going to do?â€ť she asked.â€śGo up to the bedroom and I will tell you what I am going to do.â€ťâ€śGive me the pistol and I will kill myself.â€ť Vawter knew what her husband was trying to do.Heth then came out of his room and all three of them struggled on the stairs. According to her testimony, her finger was on the trigger of the Iver Johnson when the shots were fired.This brings up an interesting point about Charles Vawterâ€™s gun, something never brought up in trial. The five-chamber, hammerless .32-caliber pistol had a relatively new feature â€” a safety trigger. The gun, cheap and widely available, was not known for being powerful or remotely accurate. The velocity of the bullet leaving the gun was too slow to make it a practical weapon outside of close range.However, that safety mechanism would likely have prevented it from firing unless the trigger was pulled. Bumping it was unlikely to cause it to fire. And because the gun was fired at point-blank range, two of the sluggish bullets were still able to pass through Hethâ€™s intestines and into the wall at the top of the stairs.A pole vaulter on what is now the Drillfield with Faculty Row in the background in the 1920s.When Heth fell over in the darkness, she immediately ran to him and called for Bull Williams to bring a candle.â€śStockton, whatever happens, remember this is all my fault,â€ť she told him.â€śNo, it is all my fault,â€ť Heth said. He then said he was cold, and Vawter grabbed a blanket from the childrenâ€™s room for him. The physicians who arrived later said the two were still together, holding hands, when they got there.When Vawter finished, it was time for the cross-examination. Jordan Lee was well known in southwest Virginia as one of the best in the business. The Roanoke Times later called Leeâ€™s drilling of her â€śthe most terrific ordeal that a woman ever went through in court.â€ťLee first tried to question whether she had sex with Heth before the first choking incident in May 1916, but the defense objected. Judge Moffett sustained. She did however admit under questioning that Heth had told her about the June 15 letter telling him to stay away from the house, and that she had â€śjumped onâ€ť her husband for kicking him out of their house.The prosecuting attorney also tried to introduce the letters for further questioning, but Moffett sustained the defenseâ€™s objection to their admission. But Lee had one other avenue of questioning.When asked, Rachel Vawter admitted that on the first night Heth choked Vawter, she had been found naked in Hethâ€™s room. The Roanoke Times, sticking to the predominant sense of morality of the time, declined to print the details of the relationship that came out in court other than to describe them as â€śhorrors of the crime that goaded Vawter to final desperation.â€ťThen, Lee asked about the October incident with the married woman guest, where Charles Vawter supposedly found â€śsignsâ€ť that Heth had sex with the guest. Under questioning, Rachel Vawter contradicted her husbandâ€™s story.He had been mistaken â€” the signs were not from the guest. It had been Rachel Vawter who had sex with Heth.The public was in a stupor. The Roanoke Times ran in large type on the front page of its May 3 edition, â€śMRS. VAWTER BARES LIFE BEFORE JURY TO SAVE HUSBAND.â€ť The details of the conference that could have saved her from testifying were printed just below.According to the Roanoke Times story, after court let out that afternoon, a couple dozen Montgomery County residents were discussing the case outside the courthouse. Someone suggested they poll the group on the outcome of the trial. Every person voted for acquittal.The front page of The World News of Roanoke on May 4, 1917.May 4 was a relatively quiet day for the journalists covering Charles Vawterâ€™s trial. In the morning, the defense called a cashier from the Bank of Blacksburg who told the court Vawter was sober when he saw him around 10 p.m. before the shooting. Another Blacksburg resident testified likewise.The defense then rested.After a 25-minute conference, the prosecution then returned to the court to introduce rebuttal witnesses. Ethel Brown, bookkeeper of the Roanoke Wine and Liquor Company that had relocated to Maryland after the state went dry, identified the companyâ€™s ledger book.When asked by Lee, she said that the company filled a number of whiskey orders for Vawterâ€™s brother. A letter from Vawter was introduced from Sept. 14, 1916, asking the company to not fill orders for that name. On cross-examination, Brown admitted they had.The foreman of Whitethorn also testified that he overheard a telephone conversation between Vawter and Heth in January in which Vawter told Heth he could find his wife alone at a friendâ€™s house in Roanoke. Defense attorney William Colhoun attacked him for eavesdropping on his employer.Jersey cows on VPIâ€™s campus in 1895.Another Blacksburg resident testified that it had actually been Bull Williamsâ€™ whiskey drunk on the night of the shooting, not Hethâ€™s. He admitted though that he was related to the Tyler and Heth families.The last witness of the morning session was Theodorick Campbell, the dean of faculty at VPI who Heth had called after being shot. He arrived at the Vawter house around 3:25 a.m. the night of the shooting. Once he got there, Williams told him that Heth had already said he had tried to stop Vawter from shooting him.Colhoun cross-examined Campbell, forcing him to admit that he was related to Heth through his wife and considered the dead man like a son. He also admitted that he had talked extensively with the prosecution about the case and would like to see Vawter punished for the death.Campbell also said that Heth had been at his house earlier that night. The dean had invited him to spend the night there, but Heth said that he needed to get home.The defense attorney also attempted to get Campbell to admit he had tried to get Vawter to confess to the crime that night. Campbell denied that was not his intention when he came to the house; he said he had phoned for Sally Miles, Vawterâ€™s brother-in-law, but done nothing else. According to the Roanoke Times, he â€śregarded (Vawter) as a capable teacher.â€ťThe trial was increasingly getting caught up in details and expert witness testimony, which bored the press to a degree. However, the most exciting parts of the trial were yet to come.The Upper Quad in the 1917â€“18 school year.The Montgomery County sheriff looked up at the gallery balcony right after Judge Moffett called to order the afternoon session of circuit court on Friday, May 4. A large crowd had gathered to watch the proceedings. The balcony was starting to sway under the weight.The sheriff told the judge, who ordered the gallery cleared quickly and quietly for safetyâ€™s sake. The proceedings would go without the spectators that had marked the trial to that point.Theodorick Campbell, the VPI dean of faculty who had been grilled in the morning, was re-called. He admitted Bull Williams had told him more than he had said in the morning, and that the two had another conversation about the shooting later when Williams came to his office. But that story changed too â€” he later admitted to defense attorney William Colhoun that he had sent for Williams to come to his office. He still denied that he asked Vawter for a confession.The prosecution then started introducing doctors to counteract the testimonies of the defenseâ€™s witnesses from two days prior. Those doctors had tried to make the case that Charles Vawter had been insane when he wrote the previously introduced scandalous letters about Heth and his wifeâ€™s relationship.Jack Lee of the prosecution asked the first doctor, from Radford, if Vawter â€” assuming that he was conducting his duties as a professor satisfactorily â€” could have been insane while writing the most unbelievable letter.The defense objected. Vawter had in fact not been performing his job duties. Robert Jordan re-called Vawter himself to the stand, where he said that during when the letter was written (May 1916), he had only one class, which met twice a week for a total of eight times that month.He missed three of those classes. Additionally, he and his wife had heard that students were complaining about his work, although he received no formal reprimand. His family had actually had an intervention for him, consisting of Vawterâ€™s mother, sister and her husband, Sally Miles, during that month.However, the doctor still said that Vawter was sane. Another two doctors from Radford and Dr. W. W. Rangeley from Christiansburg also testified that Vawter likely was sane throughout the last year. Colhoun still managed to poke holes in their diagnoses though, riffing on the thin line between what he described as â€śdegeneracyâ€ť and insanity.The front page of The World News of Roanoke from May 5, 1917.On Saturday morning, the 16 members of the jury and the judge for the trial of Vawterâ€™s took a trip in open-top automobiles to Blacksburg. Along with the sheriff and two deputies, they were going to the scene of the crime â€” the home of Charles Vawter.Several journalists accompanied the party on its excursion. A staff correspondent for the Roanoke Times noted the eerie nature of the home where Stockton Heth had been killed. A fire had been kindled in the fireplace to warm up the jurors. On Vawterâ€™s desk in the study, a thin layer of dust covered the physics textbook he had been writing when Heth was shot.While jurors went upstairs, the Times correspondent stepped into the dining room. There, Charles Vawter was discussing the sale of a piece of mahogany furniture with another journalist. As the Times correspondent and Vawter walked out of the room, Vawter picked up a small wrench from a table.â€śThis is all I have left of my car,â€ť Vawter told the reporter. â€śI sold it last week.â€ťUpstairs, the locations of the bullets lodged in the wall of the home were measured. One was just shy of five feet off the floor; another was just over six inches. The two were a little bit under a foot apart. It appeared that Vawter had shot Heth in a struggle; otherwise, it seemed unlikely they could have been spread out so far and still gone through Heth.An automobile at VPI in the 1920s.The court reconvened in Christiansburg at 11:15 a.m. A VPI student presented a drawing of where the bullets had been found for the courtroom, after which the prosecution rested, although the defense had allowed them to call more witnesses later.The defense called a farmer that insinuated the Whitethorn farm manager had fabricated his testimony the previous day, based on a story he had told him about an argument he witnessed between Charles and Rachel Vawter.Charles Vawter and Bull Williams were also re-called, contradicting Campbellâ€™s claim that he did not ask Vawter for a confession after the shooting. They both said that Campbell said, â€śProfessor Vawter, I am an older man than you are. If you have anything to say you had better say it to me.â€ťThe defense tried to shore up that argument with six character witnesses, ranging from professors to liverymen, who said that Williams was trustworthy.The defense also called Sally Miles who testified that he had indeed participated in Vawterâ€™s intervention last May. Over the objection of the prosecution, he also recounted what Williams had told him that Heth had said after being shot. He had gone into Williamsâ€™ room to ask about the shooting after arriving at the house, called there by Campbell. Another VPI student who had come to the home after hearing about it said he heard some of that conversation and could corroborate it.The defense also recalled one of the prosecutionâ€™s doctors from the previous day, Dr. Rangeley of Christiansburg. Apparently, he had been first asked by the defense to testify whether Vawter was sane, though he did not tell the attorneys at the time if he was sane or not. Miles was also re-called â€” he said that Dr. Rangeley had told him the night after the letter was first introduced in court that Vawter was insane. Dr. Rangeley returned to the stand to say that he hadnâ€™t read the letter at that point.The trial seemed to be heading for a conclusion; the court did not reconvene on Sunday. However, the participants increasingly earned the contempt of the public. A Roanoke Times account called Vawter either a â€śa weak and pitiful wreck of the damning demon of drinkâ€ť or â€śa fiend in human form.â€ťVPI cadets on Miles Field in the 1920s.On Monday, May 7, Judge Moffett chose to convene court in the Wilmont Theatre, the only movie theater in town. The theater was an odd place to hold court, but it was the only adequately sized building in the area, and there were lingering concerns that the courthouse might have been irreparably damaged by the large crowds. At the entrance, posters advertised the silent films that were playing: â€śAn Oily Scoundrel,â€ť â€śZazaâ€ť and â€śMarthaâ€™s Indication.â€ť The Roanoke Times reporter thought that some of those titles were serendipitous.Some of the seats from the floor were relocated to the stage for the jury to sit in. Judge Moffett traded his chair in the courthouse for a cane-bottomed seat. The stage lights kept the jurorâ€™s faces bathed in an eerie colored glow. Journalists were relegated to the orchestra loft, where they sat among the drums and piano.Dr. J. K. Hall testified at length for the defense about the nature of alcoholic insanity. Dr. Hall was the superintendent of the Westbrook Sanatorium in Richmond, one of the largest addiction rehabilitation centers in the South at the time. He was quite clear about Vawterâ€™s mental state.â€śAlcohol preserves what is put into it and destroys what it is put into,â€ť Dr. Hall told the court, quoting what he said was an old Scottish proverb.A second doctor, this one from Roanoke, was questioned by Allen Harless from the defense (which is only the least bit interesting because Harless was considered the bookish one on the team). Jack Lee was unable to shake either of the doctorâ€™s insistence that alcohol consumption leads to insanity, which manifested itself in the form of the letters which confounded the courtroom in 1917.Around 2:30 p.m., the court moved back to the courthouse. It was determined that it was safe as long as the gallery was not used. Two more doctors were called by the prosecution, though their credentials were shaky â€” one, Dr. J. C. King admitted he rarely saw insane patients in practice and the other was related to the Tyler and Heth families (King had recently opened a new sanatorium in Radford in Hethâ€™s old high school).After the testimony, both sides rested. Moffett and the attorneys retired to chambers to work out the details of jury instructions and the order of closing statements.An advertisement for the silent film â€śZaza,â€ť starring Pauline Frederick.Tuesday, May 8, was the second day of rain and cold in Christiansburg. It was a perfect day for nearby farmers to go to the courthouse and hear what promised to be a dramatic closing act â€” the closing arguments of the defense and prosecuting attorneys.Robert Jordan started off for the defense. He had a heavy weight on his shoulders; his team was all that stood between Charles Vawter and the electric chair. Luckily, this is where Jordan shone.Jordan told the jury that he had prayed to God so that he might speak the truth. In detail, he recounted the moments after Vawter had shot Stockton Heth, when he went into his childrenâ€™s room and gathered them in his arms. One or two members of the jury were already starting to cry.He then recounted Rachel Vawterâ€™s testimony and attacked the prosecution, particularly for their desperate attempts to find doctors to rebut the defenseâ€™s assertions that Vawter was insane. Most of the speech he dedicated to the infamous letter where Vawter appears to trade his wife for his liquor bill in Roanoke.Jordan worked with trademark sarcasm and wit. He reminded the jury that Edgar Allan Poe probably had written â€śThe Ravenâ€ť while in a drunken frenzy. Not one to mince words, he also reminded the jury of Dr. William Hendersonâ€™s description of Vawter as having the mind of a child. Heth and Rachel Vawter had conspired against the man on trial and â€śmolded as the potter molds his clay.â€ťIn the next dayâ€™s account in the paper, the journalist described how the â€śjury broke down and cried like babies â€” a scene never witnessed in the experience of seasoned newspaper men who have reported some of the most sensational criminal cases in the country.â€ťâ€ś(Heth) enjoyed the fruits of his bargain without even meeting its terms, either as to the pecuniary consideration or the first article of the agreement, which was that he was to destroy the letter as soon as read! Why did he want to keep it? Was he proud of the kind of bargain he could drive?â€ť Jordan shouted to the jury, according to the Roanoke Times, while attacking Heth.In his opening statement, commonwealthâ€™s attorney Redmond Roop had said the defense would come with a bucket of whitewash for Vawterâ€™s reputation and a bucket of tar for Hethâ€™s. Jordan told the jury he didnâ€™t need tar. Roop had brought it for him, in the form of the famous letter.After recounting the final moments of when Heth was shot, Jordan reminded the jury of the words of Jesus in the Bible to a crowd that is about to stone a woman accused of adultery â€” â€śLet him that is without sin among you cast the first stone.â€ťSeveral of the jurors at this point had pulled out their handkerchiefs and buried their faces in them. The entire courtroom, according to a Roanoke Times account, was deeply moved. Judge Moffett saw that the jury was in no condition to proceed. He asked the sheriff to take the jury outside for 10 or 15 minutes to let them compose themselves.A staff correspondent for the Roanoke Times called Jordanâ€™s speech â€śmasterly.â€ť In the next dayâ€™s account in the paper, the journalist described how the â€śjury broke down and cried like babies â€” a scene never witnessed in the experience of seasoned newspaper men who have reported some of the most sensational criminal cases in the country.â€ťFaculty Row and the Extension Building on VPIâ€™s campus in 1916.The remaining closing arguments by the attorneys failed to live up to Robert Jordanâ€™s fireworks. Allen Harless provided a second closing argument to the defense, making less of an emotional and more of a logical appeal, followed by William Colhoun. Redmond Roop made the first closing argument for the prosecution, arguing it was Vawterâ€™s questionable morality that led to Hethâ€™s premature death. Roop also made a biblical reference â€” his to Josephâ€™s temptation by the wife of Pharaohâ€™s chief captain in the Book of Genesis â€” but his did not leave the jury in tears.Court reconvened on the afternoon of May 9, a rainless day that had a more seasonable, spring-like feel. Jack Lee, the renowned attorney brought in to help the prosecution, delivered a two-and-a-half-hour long speech that attempted to rival Jordanâ€™s eloquence. Things were still uncertain when the jury retired to deliberate at 4:35 p.m.Twenty minutes into deliberations, the jury asked for the letters and Charles Vawterâ€™s torn nightshirt as evidence. Discussion continued until 7 p.m.In the courtroom, the other attorneys had gone home, leaving only Robert Jordan with Charles Vawter in the courthouse. Some reporters and a handful of spectators remained when it was announced that the jury was ready. The deputy clerk read the decision to the courtroom.â€śWe, the jury, find the defendant, Charles E. Vawter, not guilty as charged in the within indictment.â€ťVawter jumped out of his chair and hugged his 69-year-old mother, who had sat by him and waited for the verdict since most of his family had gone to Blacksburg. â€śOh glory!â€ť she shouted to the courtroom. Jordan, sitting in his chair at the table, lifted his hand to the sky and said, â€śThank God!â€ť before beginning to cry.One of the reporters still in the courthouse found a telephone and called Rachel Vawter, who was at home in Blacksburg with the children. She was overjoyed with the news but told the journalist that she couldnâ€™t make a statement â€” she needed to tell Charlie and Rachel that daddy was coming home.Evidently, the trial had never even been close in the minds of the jury. An unnamed member of it told the Roanoke Times that it had been decided in a single ballot. They would have accepted either theory of the defense â€” both insanity and self-defense appeared to apply.When Charles Vawter returned to Blacksburg, a number of his friends and neighbors came by to congratulate him. According to the Roanoke Times, it appeared that the residents of Blacksburg by and large approved of the verdict.Before he headed home that night, a member of the jury told a Roanoke Times reporter how futile Roop and Leeâ€™s efforts had been. Their minds had been made up before the trial even started.The front page of the Richmond Times-Dispatch from May 10, 1917.The trial was over and Vawter was freed, but the saga was not over, especially not for VPI. The school was already in tough shape as many students and alumni marched off to fight in Europe. At least 42 percent of all alumni of VPI fought in the war â€” 28 were killed in battle or died in camps. In April, the school had become a training for the Army and Navy to help with the war effort.Meanwhile, VPI President Joseph Eggleston had a public relations nightmare on his hands. The Vawter trial had received attention throughout the country in no small part due to Charles Vawterâ€™s position as the head of the physics department. Editorials appeared throughout the country damning the loose morals apparently rampant in Blacksburg.â€śThe conduct of Heth and the Vawters, and perhaps one or two of their associates, became a subject of comment and gossip in the Blacksburg community and beyond,â€ť wrote the Bristol Herald-Courier in a May 10, 1917, editorial. A clipping from the story was found among Egglestonâ€™s papers. â€śWhy, under the circumstances, Vawter was retained on the faculty of the college, and permitted to maintain a residence on the college campus, is a mystery which those responsible for the management of the institution will have to explain.â€ťEggleston helped lead the campaign to scrub the stain of Vawter and Heth from the university. The rector of the local episcopal church and VPI chaplain, R. B. Nelson, wrote to a number of friends in Baltimore, Maryland, asking for their support.â€śIt is simply incredible that a whole community should be so damned unheard. Yet this is exactly what has been done by some of the editorials which have come to my notice,â€ť Nelson wrote in one letter, dated May 8, 1917. He implored his friends to reach out to the Baltimore papers to try to quiet the storm.For the most part, Egglestonâ€™s efforts worked. The trial of Vawter is not mentioned in the universityâ€™s historical digest, a detailed history of the school. It never appeared in The Virginia Tech, the Collegiate Timesâ€™ predecessor.In spring 1919, Eggleston surprised the school by announcing he would resign at the end of the term. He later took the job of president at Hampden-Sydney College. His work in Blacksburg was done.A night view of Broad Street in Philadelphia, circa 1916.Charles and Rachel Vawter also had to leave Blacksburg after Vawterâ€™s resignation. In June, Charles Vawter wrote to Eggleston to settle the situation of his house on Faculty Row. The university wanted to charge Vawter $1,000 due to smoke damage in the house (in an attempt to unfreeze pipes in winter, he had set a fire in a grate in the servantâ€™s closet).Vawterâ€™s next letters to Eggleston found him heading north to New York in search of employment. Eggleston agreed to write a letter of reference for Vawter when he applied to the Queen-Gray Company, a scientific instrument company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In his letter of reference, Eggleston skipped over the reasons for Vawterâ€™s departure and called him â€śa teacher of unusual abilityâ€ť and â€śgifted in his line of work.â€ť He did not get the job.On July 28, Vawter wrote to Eggleston that he had found a job â€” his boss had â€śnever heard of me till I met him by appointment,â€ť but had taken him on nonetheless without recommendation. Vawter did ask Eggleston that his last salary payment come soon; his insurance was due on Aug. 5.Vawter eventually managed to find steady work. It was in the years after leaving VPI that he invented most of his devices for a handful of different companies, gaining quite a reputation for his more than 200 creations. According to an Associated Press obituary, he retired around 1921 to focus on his experiments.Although Vawter had managed to find a job, it was a tough several years for the family. Vawterâ€™s mother, Virginia Longley, died June 5, 1918, in Roanoke and was buried alongside her husband at the Miller School that he had helped found. Charles Vawter III died Sept. 4, 1925, also while living in Roanoke, and was buried in Blacksburg beside his uncle, Edmund Vawter, who had died in 1912.Rachel, the Vawtersâ€™ daughter, married legendary VPI coach Henry â€śPussâ€ť Redd, a 1921 graduate who served in France in World War I. Redd, known as â€śBig Bear,â€ť lost only one game to Alabama University in his first year as head coach in 1932 (and it was only a 9â€“6 loss, to boot).Many years later, in 1997, an endowment fund was established in Reddâ€™s name by an anonymous donor to recognize his later work as alumni secretary for the school. The fund has been used to acquire and preserve materials in the universityâ€™s Special Collections, indirectly helping the writing of this story.In 1931, Rachel and Charles were living in the Germantown area of northwest Philadelphia. On May 19, Vawter was working on a new ignition system for airplanes alone in his home laboratory.He was lubricating a motor when a spark set the oil alight. An explosion covered Vawterâ€™s clothes in flaming oil. Rachel, hearing the commotion, wrapped him in a bed quilt in a futile attempt to smother the flame and burned her hands badly in the process.His final appearance in the press was his obituary, which was printed in the New York Times and Chicago Tribune. Charles Vawter died about 24 hours later on May 20, 1931.The headstone of Charles Vawter III and Edmund Vawter in Westview Cemetery, July 15, 2017.A stone marking the grave of Charles Vawter Jr. in Westview Cemetery, July 15, 2017.A stone marking the grave of Rachel Vawter in Westview Cemetery, July 15, 2017.The story of the Vawters and Heth is notable for a number of reasons. For one, it features some of the most prominent people in Virginia Tech history. Charles Vawter Sr., Joseph Eggleston, Sally Miles, Theodorick Campbell and Frank Robeson all have buildings named after them on Virginia Techâ€™s campus.Another reason is that it had a profound, though subtle, impact on the future of the university. After Stockton Heth Sr. and Clement Heth died in 1927 and 1930 respectively, Whitethorn was slowly sold off to the university, Blacksburg and Radford, allowing a new age of development.The media frenzy surrounding the trial is curious too, given the fact that journalists are still fascinated by scandalous cases like that of the Vawterâ€™s. The timing is also notable â€” as VPI students were marching off to fight for their lives in Europe, Vawter was standing in a courtroom in a small town in Virginia, begging for his.Reading about the scandalous affairs of Stockton Heth Jr. and Charles Vawter were a form of escapism for a war-weary country. Accounts of the trial made it in print all across the country, from New York to Arizona. For one week in May, Vawterâ€™s name would appear next to those of Kaiser Wilhelm II and Vladimir Lenin.The case is also remarkable because it touches on a number of themes still relevant today. Stockton Heth Jr. sexually assaulted Rachel Vawter by her own account, using alcohol to take advantage of her. The scenes may have changed, but the problem remains the same.According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, 11.2 percent of undergraduate and graduate students have experienced rape or sexual assault. About 23 percent of female undergraduate students experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or incapacitation, just like what Rachel Vawter described in that courtroom in 1917.Twenty percent of female students between the ages of 18 and 24 who are victims will report their experience to law enforcement. Vawterâ€™s testimony in court was an exception and a rare glimpse into something that people did not talk about in 1917 (and rarely do today). However, today we do have some resources â€” if you are sexually assaulted, you do have options; the Virginia Tech Police Department recommends visiting stopabuse.vt.edu to learn more.The Roanoke Times had called it â€śone of the most remarkable cases in the history of Virginiaâ€ť â€” and that was before Vawter was even charged with the murder. It has all the elements of a good crime novel, down to the very ending, a crime novel that seems a little bit too real.Editor in ChiefPreviously web engineer, assistant news editor, Town of Blacksburg reporter, news staff writer.

During its existence, the university has operated under four different legal names. The founding name was Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College. Following a reorganization of the college in the 1890s, the state legislature changed the name to Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute, effective March 5, 1896. Faced with such an unwieldy name, people began calling it Virginia Polytechnic Institute, or simply VPI. On June 23, 1944, the legislature followed suit, officially changing the name to Virginia Polytechnic Institute. At the same time, the commonwealth moved most women’s programs from VPI to nearby Radford College, and that school’s official name became Radford College, Women’s Division of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The commonwealth dissolved the affiliation between the two colleges in 1964. The state legislature sanctioned university status for VPI and bestowed upon it the present legal name, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, effective June 26, 1970. While some older alumni and other friends of the university continue to call it VPI, its most popular –and its official—nickname today is Virginia Tech.© 2014 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State UniversityThe Larchmont Elementary School was originally built in 1912 and was located on the northwest corner of Hampton Boulevard and Bolling Avenue. An addition was constructed in 1921-22. From 1919-1930, the College of William and Mary offered weekly extension courses for southside students in the Larchmont Elementary School building. The building became available for purchase when a replacement elementary school was constructed across the street.  
                      In March 1930, William and Mary acquired the building from the city of Norfolk and purchased 12 acres of land adjacent to the old school for the purpose of establishing the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary. Renovations to the old school and land acquisition cost approximately $51,415.

was one of the original administrators of the Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary. He was interviewed by Robert H. Land of William & Mary on  
                      June 9, 1960.See other ODU founders ... In the winter of 1930, when I heard that the Norfolk city school board was to build a new elementary school in Larchmont, ... I realized that the old elementary school would be abandoned. So I went down to see Mr. Hughes. I said, "Mr. Hughes [Robert Morton Hughes], here is our opportunity to bring a college to Norfolk by using the old Larchmont Elementary School building when it's abandoned." [As Mr. Healy, Mr. Hughes, Dr. J.A.C. Chandler, and Mr. A. H. Foreman looked over the school and land....]Dr. Chandler looked over the building. "Fine, fine," he said. There was some open land right near it, near the Larchmont School. "Foreman, see all that property out there? Get an option on that property."  This was April, 1930, if I remember correctly. I didn't hear any more then until about the 15th of June .... and I got a call from Mr. Foreman's office. Dr. Chandler said, "Healy, come on down here as soon as you can get here." So I got in my car and drove down. Dr. Chandler was a very direct man; he wasted no words whatsoever. "Healy, go out to the Larchmont School Monday morning, have a telephone installed, employ a secretary, prepare a catalog, and start enrolling students. I will pay you $500." And that's all he said -- just like that. Those were the words he used. The facility was renamed the "Administration Building" and became the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary's all-purpose campus center. The building contained classrooms, administration offices, a library, and science laboratories. In 1931, a snack bar was added and became a favorite student hangout. Prior to the snack bar addition, the Norfolk Division students ate lunch in the new Larchmont Elementary School's cafeteria across the street. In that same year, Virginia Polytechnic Institute also offered extension courses at the Division. Lewis W. Webb, Jr. was President of the Norfolk Division and Old Dominion College from 1946-1969. James R. Sweeney conducted several interviews with Webb from November 1974-February 1975. ... Everything was in the one building which was.... The front of the building had six classrooms and a few offices, which the offices at that time were the former cloak rooms. The elementary school had a cloak room in the back of each room, and we divided those into two pieces and had the faculty offices in the cloak rooms. So, it wasn't quite plush.In the 1940s, after the current Administration Building (Rollins Hall) was completed, the old Larchmont Elementary School became known as the "Science Hall" or "Science Building" until a new science building was constructed in 1954.In 1955, the building became the "Old Science Building" and was renovated at a cost of $24,150. The Speech Center's pilot program (later the Speech and Hearing Clinic) began in the old Science Building in 1955. Started by Professor Reuben Cooper of the Speech Department, the Center was later moved to the Child Study Center. 
1960s view From the 1960s through 1975, classrooms and offices in the old Larchmont Elementary School continued to be utilized (e.g., English, Political Science, Art, Foreign Languages, Geology), but time had taken its toll on the old building -- it was razed in 1975. Old Dominion University saved 10,000 bricks from the building, and for years afterward presented them as bookends to retiring ODU personnel.

11 Aug 2010Charlie L. Yates, the first African American graduate of Virginia Tech, a member of the university’s corps of cadets and later a member of the College of Engineering faculty, has died after a long battle with Leukemia. He was 74.Yates made history in June 1958 as the first African American to graduate from Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI), still part of a South that largely practiced segregation in private and public – education, place of worship, neighborhoods, restaurants, and movie theaters. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, with honors, and was hailed as the first African American “to be graduated from any major Southern engineering institute,” according to media reports at the time.“Charlie was a pioneer among young black Virginians in the 1950s. He helped knocked down barriers at Virginia Tech that opened the doors for others to follow,” said Charles W. Steger, president of Virginia Tech. “It is noteworthy that he was one of six honors graduates in mechanical engineering in 1958. He will be long remembered throughout this academy for his many accomplishments. We were very proud to name one of our residence halls, Peddrew-Yates, in his honor.”Yates was admitted to VPI in 1954, the second class to admit any African Americans. One earlier black student, Irving L. Peddrew III entered VPI the prior year, also joining the corps as required of all male underclassmen, to study electrical engineering. With Peddrew’s admission, VPI moved ahead of court orders and became the first historically white, four-year public institution among the 11 states in the former Confederacy to admit a black undergraduate. Two other African American students were in admitted in 1954 with Yates, but did not graduate.All were enrolled in the College of Engineering, as were the handful of other black students admitted in the 1950s on the legal basis that no black college in Virginia offered an engineering program. None were allowed to sleep in dorms or eat in university cafeterias, instead taking nourishment and rest with African American families in town. Only once was Yates allowed to take a meal on campus, while pulling guard duty, according to a 1997 VT Magazine article: “There I was in the dining hall, off to myself, eating a meal,” the article quotes Yates as saying.Yates recalled fond memories as well in various interviews. In a 1981 interview for a College of Engineering publication, Yates said he persevered because “I was determined to be successful and I spent a significant amount of time studying.” With a young Christiansburg woman who would later become his wife, Yates attended the university’s ring dance, with students voting positively on the matter over then-administration disapproval. “The fact that my classmates agreed to my attendance was indicative of the very good relationship I had with my fellow students … To the extent that was possible, I was made to feel like any other student as far as classroom activities were concerned. After graduation, Yates obtained a master’s degree from Cal Tech in 1959. He briefly worked with Westinghouse, before moving to a job in research at the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins University. He also broke new ground there, becoming the first African American hired at the facility. He stayed for 19 years. In 1978, he earned a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins.Yates returned to Virginia Tech in 1979 as a faculty member in the mechanical engineering department, at the urging of Paul Torgersen, dean of the College of Engineering from 1970 to 1990 and subsequently president of Virginia Tech. In 1983, Yates left his position at Virginia Tech to head an engineering program at Hampton University, then served as a visiting associate professor at Old Dominion University. In 1987, he once again returned to Virginia Tech, as an associate professor in the aerospace and ocean engineering department. He remained at Virginia Tech until his retirement in 2000, when he was named professor emeritus. Yates also served a term on the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors.“Charlie was a gentle soul, a wonderful teacher and a role model when we desperately needed one. He leaves a significant legacy for the College of Engineering,” said Torgersen. Added Karen Eley Sanders, interim vice president for diversity and inclusion at Virginia Tech: “Dr. Yates was a pioneer who paved the way to and through college for thousands of young African American scholars around the nation. His impact on the Virginia Tech community will live on.”Yates’ presence is felt on campus to this day. In 2003, the Peddrew-Yates Residence Hall was dedicated, and in 2005, the Yates Projects ambassador program was established. The program pays current students for recruitment visits to potential freshmen in their home areas during school breaks. It is coordinated through the Office of Admissions.Services for Yates will be held at 10:30 a.m., Monday, August 16, at Rosewood Kellum Funeral Home in Virginia Beach, Va. Burial will follow at Rosewood Memorial Park. The family will receive friends from 6 – 8 pm on Sunday, August 15, at the funeral home.

            © 2017 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University  Thomas Marshall Hahn Jr. joined the Virginia Tech community in 1954 as head of the physics department. In 1959 he left for Kansas State University, where he was dean of arts and sciences until Tech’s board of visitors asked him to succeed Newman as president on July 1, 1962. The new president—at age 35, Virginia Tech’s youngest—was an experienced physicist, teacher, and administrator.Hahn presided over a period of exciting, rapid changes, guiding VPI from college status to a major research university. From the beginning of his tenure, he referred to VPI as “the university,” and in 1970 the state followed suit, officially changing Tech’s name to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.To reflect the rapid changes in social, political, and economic conditions occurring in Virginia, Hahn successfully recommended a philosophy of development to reflect his university-oriented direction for the school. For the first time, VPI made a public commitment toward a university education rather than a technical one. The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia agreed with the philosophy, endorsing the expansion of doctoral programs into non-science, as well as engineering and science areas. In 1966 the legislature created an institution-wide research division, which consolidated the role of the Virginia Engineering Experiment Station and the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station. The legislature also created an Extension Division to consolidate all of the institution’s extension activities, including operation and development of programs at the Donaldson Brown Center for Continuing Education. By the end of the 1960s the research division could boast annual research funding exceeding $9 million.To prepare for a major influx of students—the student body increased by about 1,000 students per year during Hahn’s administration, nearly tripling during his tenure—construction began on new dormitories and academic buildings, other buildings were renovated or enlarged, and support facilities enlarged or added. The coliseum received 600 additional seats; Miles Stadium was razed, replaced in a different location by Lane Stadium; and all-weather tennis courts and a new track were added. The airport gained a longer runway, requiring removal of the Norfolk and Western Railway spur to Blacksburg and ending use of the famous Huckleberry train, which had carried members of the corps to and from Blacksburg for years. Faculty ranks grew as well. In 1966 alone, more than 100 new professors joined the staff.Also during Hahn’s administration, the VPI Educational Foundation acquired 140 acres for the development of a university research park, which later became the Blacksburg Industrial Park; the school boasted its first Rhodes Scholar; the college created dean of women, director of alumni affairs, director of public relations, and dean of men positions, with the board of visitors adding vice president for student affairs, executive vice president, and vice president for finance positions; Wytheville Community College and the Clifton Forge-Covington Area Community College (now Dabney S. Lancaster Community College) opened as VPI branch schools (in 1966 they moved into the state’s new community college system); Tech received the Reynolds homestead and about 700 acres in Patrick County; Hahn built a home off-campus; and the school won the Southern Conference championship in football for the first time, only to withdraw from the conference a couple of years later to assume independent status.Hahn initiated two moves that had a major impact on Virginia Tech’s future. The merger with Radford College was dissolved, effective July 1, 1964, and membership in the corps of cadets became voluntary, effective the 1964-65 session, arousing the ire of many alumni. Four years later, the corps and the civilian student body joined forces to create a single student government. Student demands, now issued from a unified voice, increased. In 1973 the corps accepted women into its ranks, preceding the service academies in doing so.Growth continued, spurred by the dissolution of ties with Radford and the change in the military requirement. The university added numerous undergraduate and graduate courses and degree programs. Graduate programs sprang up at centers in various parts of the state, and off-campus credit enrollment grew dramatically. By 1971 the university had 61 master’s level programs and 31 doctoral programs. International study and travel became a regular part of many academic programs, and the grading system was changed from a three-point to a four-point system. Colleges of architecture and education were added, and the groundwork was laid for a college of veterinary medicine.As the school grew, the student body assumed a different profile. With increasing numbers of their cohorts drafted to fight in Vietnam, the students became more aware of national and international issues. As their awareness grew, so did their demands to participate in decisions affecting them and their willingness to speak out on various issues. Sit-ins and teach-ins became commonplace in the late 1960s, and student unrest culminated in a student occupation of Cowgill and Williams halls. After being forcibly removed from Williams Hall, more than a hundred were arrested on trespassing charges and were handed two-quarter suspensions as police escorted them from the building. In 1974, citing the need for a “periodic infusion of new ideas and new approaches,” Hahn resigned to join the management of Georgia-Pacific Corporation. The corporation purchased his home on Rainbow Ridge and gave it to the university to use as its permanent president’s residence.In 1975 the board of visitors named Hahn president emeritus, in 1987 the university conferred an honorary doctor of science degree upon him, and in 1991 a new chemistry laboratory building was named for him.

years later he received his Ph.D. degree in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  His professional and
industrial experiences prior to assuming the presidency of VPI were impressive.  While serving in the Navy, he was a
lecturer in physics at the US Naval Academy Preparatory School.  He was also a physicist at the Naval Ordinance
Laboratory and a teaching fellow for one year and a research assistant for two years at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.  In 1950, he returned to the University of Kentucky as associate professor and director of nuclear
acceleration laboratories at Kentucky.  In 1954, he came to VPI as professor and head of the Department of Physics.
In this latter capacity, he was the leading force in establishing a doctoral program in nuclear engineering physics,
and in the acquisition of the nuclear reactor simulator that was put into operation in 1957.  He was also one of the
leaders in securing a $350,000 grant from the Atomic Energy Commission from which the UTR-10 critical reactor was
secured.  In 1954, he moved from VPI to Kansas State University as Dean of Arts and Sciences and returned to VPI in
1962 as president.

In addition to his educational experiences, he had served as consultant and physicist for a number of corporations
and as a research participant in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

As a professor at VPI, he had also demonstrated an unusual adeptness in face to face exchanges with students,
faculty, and legislative committees.

The reins of presidency passed to Hahn on July 1, 1962.  Since that day was Sunday, his first day in the presidents
office was Monday July 2, 1962.  By coincidence that date was the identical one on which one hundred years earlier
Abraham Lincoln had signed the Morrill Land Grant Act into law.  Locally, much attention was given this coincidence. 
Nationally a centennial celebration was taking place in Washington, D.C. with Senator George Aiken of Morrill's home
state of Vermont making the principal address.  Senator A. Willis Robertson, of Virginia, introduced a long statement
into the Congressional Record, pointing out that Thomas Jefferson had advocated a broad system of education as early
as 1776.  Continuing his statement, Robertson correctly implied that the program at VPI was implementing a part of
Jefferson's philosophy.  After highlighting the work done at VPI, Robertson paid high tribute to retiring President
Newman and extended congratulations to incoming President Hahn.  Senator Harry T. Byrd sent a telegram congratulating
VPI on its ninetieth anniversary and the celebration of the Land Grant Act.  "I join with all Virginia," he said, "in
expressing gratitude for the work of Dr. Newman as president.  My sincere congratulations are extended to Dr. T.
Marshall Hahn, Jr., as he becomes the eleventh president of VPI."

In addition to the two senators, three congressmen also sent messages and inserted statements in the
Congressional Record in which they praised the record that had been established by Newman and congratulated Dr.
Hahn upon his election to the presidency of VPI.  Other messages and congratulations continued to pour in all day.  

Locally, Hahn's first day in office was largely an open office affair as he greeted old acquaintances who trooped
by to extend heart warming greetings.  Interviews were sought by and given to the press and TV cameramen.  Hahn met
the test and through the press presented the image of a young man eager to continue the "tremendous progress" made by
Dr. Newman.  "Land grant colleges were established as institutions of the people," he observed.  "Our mission is first
to provide educational opportunities for the young people of Virginia and the nation."  The fact that Dr. Hahn
constantly used the term university when referring to VPI did not go unnoticed by those who called upon him his first
day in office.  Declaring himself as extremely enthusiastic about becoming president of VPI, he said that first he
wanted to catch his breath and then become reacquainted with the university.  Later more than one professor claimed
that the period of breath catching was the only time they had been able to keep up with the energetic Hahn.

Although mentioning instruction, research and extension, Hahn's message marks the first time in VPI history that an
incoming president in his salutatory remarks failed to mention promotion of agricultural and engineering education as
constituting the chief mission of VPI.

The happiness so evident in campus when Hahn became president on Monday was rudely broken on Tuesday when Vice
President Pardue was seriously injured in a car crash at the foot of Christiansburg Mountain on the Roanoke Road.
After a lengthy stay in the hospital, Pardue returned to Blacksburg, but in March he requested that he be relieved of
his present position and assigned to less arduous duties.  The request was granted by the board, but about a month
later he died at his home before assuming his new duties.

One of the new members coming to the Board of Visitors in late June was H. C. Wyatt who had served on the State
Council of Higher Education.  His experience there gave him a valuable understanding of the overall system and the
problems of higher education in Virginia.

Dr. Hahn announced the appointment of Dr. Warren W. Brandt, associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at
Kansas State University, to the vice presidency at VPI to succeed Dr. Pardue.  Dr. Brandt reported for duty on
July 1, 1963.  His credentials were impressive, and he immediately plunged into the academic intricacies of the
developing institution.

A first for VPI was the appointment of W. W. Lewis ('35) as a Rhodes Scholar.  The entire Tech community applauded
that appointment.

Hahn's formal inauguration as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute was held on April 4, 1963.  Following
greetings from representatives of many prestigious groups, Hahn gave his inaugural address.  In this address, in an
effort to show where his administration would have to start its growth, Hahn presented a picture of the onward growth
achieved by VPI during the first ninety years of its existence.  The picture was a fascinating one but too lengthy for
inclusion here.

Dr. Hahn's administration showed such fantastic growth and progress in all the administrative, instructional, and
extension programs that long before the end of his administration it was abundantly clear that VPI was a flourishing
land grant university in all ways except name.  By 1970, however, legislation was introduced to and passed by the
legislature whereby the name of the college officially became Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,
effective July 1, 1970.
The first century belonged to Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College.  The second century belongs to the
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

The happiness so evident in campus when Hahn became president on Monday was rudely broken on Tuesday when Vice
President Pardue was seriously injured in a car crash at the foot of Christiansburg Mountain on the Roanoke Road.
After a lengthy stay in the hospital, Pardue returned to Blacksburg, but in March he requested that he be relieved of
his present position and assigned to less arduous duties.  The request was granted by the board, but about a month
later he died at his home before assuming his new duties.

One of the new members coming to the Board of Visitors in late June was H. C. Wyatt who had served on the State
Council of Higher Education.  His experience there gave him a valuable understanding of the overall system and the
problems of higher education in Virginia.

Dr. Hahn announced the appointment of Dr. Warren W. Brandt, associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at
Kansas State University, to the vice presidency at VPI to succeed Dr. Pardue.  Dr. Brandt reported for duty on
July 1, 1963.  His credentials were impressive, and he immediately plunged into the academic intricacies of the
developing institution.

A first for VPI was the appointment of W. W. Lewis ('35) as a Rhodes Scholar.  The entire Tech community applauded
that appointment.

Hahn's formal inauguration as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute was held on April 4, 1963.  Following
greetings from representatives of many prestigious groups, Hahn gave his inaugural address.  In this address, in an
effort to show where his administration would have to start its growth, Hahn presented a picture of the onward growth
achieved by VPI during the first ninety years of its existence.  The picture was a fascinating one but too lengthy for
inclusion here.

Dr. Hahn's administration showed such fantastic growth and progress in all the administrative, instructional, and
extension programs that long before the end of his administration it was abundantly clear that VPI was a flourishing
land grant university in all ways except name.  By 1970, however, legislation was introduced to and passed by the

		Phone: 540-231-6308Land & Labor AcknowledgmentSite MapOn October 1, 1872, Virginia Tech opened as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College. All students were cadets organized into a battalion of two companies with an enrollment of 132. The Commandant of Cadets was General James H. Lane, formerly the youngest general in the Army of Northern Virginia, who was wounded three times in combat. He worked to provide both the best education and the best military training in the state for his cadets based on his experience in the Civil War, as a student at VMI and UVA, and teacher at Florida State Seminary and North Carolina Military Institute. General Lane is considered the father of the Corps. He wrote the first cadet regulations and began a tradition of academic and military excellence. In 1878, President Charles Minor wanted to do away with the strict military requirements. Lane opposed him and their disagreement became so heated that a faculty meeting ended with a fist fight between the two. Both left campus in the ensuing scandal but the Corps remained.The VAMC cadets made their first Corps trip in 1875 to Richmond to the dedication of the Lee Monument. Through the years the Corps has made many trips. These trips were more frequent in the early years including the Pan–American Exposition in New York in 1901 and the St. Louis Worlds Fair in 1904. In 1880, political mismanagement from Richmond helped enrollment drop to 78 cadets. That same year William & Mary dropped to 27 students and closed temporarily. In the ensuing years, however, enrollment and educational opportunities were expanded. E Battery, manning four Civil War artillery pieces with upperclassmen, existed between 1883 and 1907.In 1896, VAMC, by law changed its name to the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute. Right away usage took on its new designation abbreviated as VPI or Virginia Tech. Also, that year began a tradition that lasted nearly three-quarters of a century, the VPI-VMI annual football game in Roanoke. Known as the Military Classic of the South, the annual Corps trips and associated parades ended in 1969.In 1898, with the outbreak of the Spanish American War, the Corps of Cadets formally volunteered to the governor for combat service. This request was declined, but most of the band and the director enlisted as the Band of the 2nd Virginia Infantry Regiment. Many alumni served in the Spanish- American War and the Philippine Insurrection. Among them, one was awarded the Medal of Honor during the Philippine Insurrection; another was cited for gallantry at the Battle of Santiago, Cuba and awarded the Silver Star. Alumni also participated in the Mexican Border Conflict between 1910 and 1919, including one who received the Medal of Honor for actions of a true peacekeeping nature in 1911.The band had first been organized in 1892. Prior to that, as early as 1883 music was provided by the “Glade Cornet Band,” an organization made up of towns people. The summer of 1902 saw the band serving as part of the 70th Virginia Infantry during large-scale national military maneuvers held in Manassas.With the approach of World War I, ROTC was established at Virginia Tech. In January of 1917, Infantry ROTC was established followed shortly by Engineer and Coast Artillery. During the war, Virginia Tech became an army post. Cadets were inducted and became enlisted men of the Student Army Training Battalion and its Navy detachment. They were uniformed in Army and Navy uniforms. Two army-training detachments of between 226 and 308 men each trained on campus.CPT J.W.G. Stephens ’15, of the 26th Infantry, led the first American forces “over on top” in combat near Montdidlier, France. Many alumni served with distinction with the 1st, 2nd, 29th and 80th Divisions, all of which saw heavy combat. A hero of note was MAJ Lloyd Williams ’07, US Marine Corps. One of the famous quotes of the war, used for years as a Marine standard was attributed to him. “Retreat, Hell No!” was his reply to the French orders to retreat his company. His company held its ground but he was killed in the action and awarded the Distinguish Service Cross. In the air, alumni, even as early as World War I, foreshadowed VPI’s contribution to the Air Force. CPL Robert G. Eoff, ’18, French Foreign Legion, attached to the 157 French Fighter Squadron shot down the first of 6 enemy aircraft credited to Techmen. LT John R. Castleman ’19 was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism in completing an aerial recognizance despite an attack of 12 enemy aircraft of which he shot down two.Virginia Tech’s contribution to the war effort included 2,297 in uniform. These included 2,155 in the Army, 125 in the Navy, 19 in the Marine Corps, 6 in the Coast Guard, 1 in the British Army and 1 in the French Foreign Legion. One alumni was awarded the Medal of Honor, seven the Distinguished Service Cross and one the Navy Cross. At least eight were awarded the Silver Star. Twenty-six died in service and another twenty-six were wounded. Based on this Virginia Tech was designated as one of twelve Distinguished Colleges by the War Department.After World War I, veterans both as new cadets and returning cadets impacted positively on the corps and university. At the same time, two other Corps of Cadets, Louisiana State and Mississippi State disbanded due to the negative reaction of post war students and veterans. In 1921, women were admitted as civilian students and attended classes as day students. The next year the Corps was reorganized into a regiment of two battalions. Two years later, military service as a cadet was reduced from four years to two; however after two years of the camaraderie of Corps’ life, very few cadets chose to convert to civilian student status. During the national rail strike of 1923 the Corps again volunteered to the Virginia Governor for active military service. They were not called upon. A Third Battalion was added to the regiment by 1927. Rapid growth followed as Virginia Tech’s reputation as both an outstanding academic and military institution grew. In 1939, a Fourth Battalion was added.For the duration of World War II, academic sessions and the Corps operated on a twelve-month cycle. The Corps had grown to a brigade of 2,650 cadets consisting of two regiments with a total of five battalions. The First Battalion was primarily Infantry ROTC. The Second Battalion was Engineer ROTC and the Third, Fourth and Fifth consisted of Cadet Batteries taking Coast Artillery ROTC. The war demanded that seniors were graduated and commissioned early. Juniors were on an accelerated schedule and brought on active duty. Finally, sophomores and freshmen over 18 were largely inducted into military service. The Corps soon numbered under 300 and was organized into a single battalion.The Commandant, in addition to the cadet battalion, supervised a unit of the Army Specialized Training Program and Army Specialized Training Reserve Program (ASTRP) (soldiers under 18 years of age) and a Navy pre-flight training unit. These units included many former cadets and they adopted many of the traditions of the Corps to include the Honor Code and saluting the Rock. The young men of the ASTRP were actually uniformed in cadet gray. Once again Virginia Tech was largely an active duty military installation. During World War II, 7,285 alumni served in uniform. The army had 5,941 men, the navy 1,059 men, 110 in the Marine Corps, 29 in the Merchant Marine, 23 in the Coast Guard, and one in the Royal Air Force. These included ten brigadier generals, five major generals and a rear admiral. Three Hundred and twenty-three died, three were awarded the Medal of Honor, seven the Distinguished Service Cross, two the Navy Cross and at least 73 the Silver Star and 94 the Distinguished Flying Cross.Following World War II, returning veterans were not required to serve in the Corps and the great influx of veterans swelled the number of civilian students. Civilian students outnumbered cadets for the first time in 1946.  That same year Air Force ROTC was introduced to Virginia Tech. Initially civilian-cadet relations with the corps were not good as most veterans were attending Virginia Tech for the first time. Thanks to the regimental commander, Cadet Rolfe Robertson ’49, a World War II Coast Guard veteran, greater understanding was promoted among his fellow veterans and the Corps continued to grow and flourish. At the same time the Corps at Clemson was disbanded.During the following years the Corps would expand again back to a regiment and eventually organize into four battalion size units. The Cadet 1st Battalion was housed at Radford Army Arsenal for two years at “Rad-Tech”. There in World War II Army barracks, the cadets lived and took many of their classes. For classes unavailable there, a fleet of buses brought them back to the main campus. As new dorms were completed, the battalion returned to campus.During the Korean War, 1,867 alumni served of whom 30 died in service and one was awarded the Medal of Honor. In 1952, the university employed a retired general as the commandant of cadets. This was a departure from the policy since 1884 where the senior active duty military instructor functioned as commandant. In 1958, Virginia Tech became the first traditionally white southern college to graduate an African American, with the graduation of Cadet Charles Yates ’58.In a move to expand educational opportunities at Virginia Tech, the board of visitors made participation in the Corps completely voluntary starting in 1964. However, the taking of ROTC continued to require Corps membership. Similar action had been taken the prior year at Texas A&M. The Vietnam War period saw unrest on campus outside the Corps ranks. In 1970, demonstrations were conducted with the aim of halting Corps drill. Cowgill and Williams Halls were occupied and over 100 arrested. Various other disorderly incidents occurred including the suspected arson of an on campus building. Civilian-Cadet relations were at an all time low. Throughout all of this, the Corps maintained discipline and high morale while at the same time the Pennsylvania Military College disappeared.The post Vietnam years saw the Corps numbers decline and reorganization to a two-battalion size regiment. In 1973, Virginia Tech was one of the first Corps of Cadets in the nation to enroll women, assigning them to L Squadron. In 1975, the first female cadet was assigned to the Band Company. In 1979, L Squadron was disbanded and female cadets integrated into the line companies. In 1981, the Cadet dormitories became coed. Naval ROTC was established in 1983. The cadet regiment expanded to a three-battalion structure in 1998. Today the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is one of only six senior military colleges outside the five federal military academies. Virginia Tech is one of only two large, public universities in the nation that maintains a full time Corps of Cadets. The other is Texas A&M.The Corps at Virginia Tech has seen many turbulent years and weathered them all. Since the Spanish American War the Corps has provided leadership in our nation’s times of need. Most recently, Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom saw nine Virginia Tech alumni killed, five of which were Corps alumni. The valor of our alumni is legendary, with seven Medal of Honor recipients, and 22 recipients of the nation’s second highest award for valor - the Distinguished Service Cross or Navy Cross. The Corps continues and always will because the spirit and devotion of its cadets and alumni will never waver. Whenever the nation has called, the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets was ready to live up to the University motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve).The PylonsThe Pylons above War Memorial Chapel bear the names of every Virginia Tech student and graduate who died defending our nation’s freedom, beginning with those lost during World War I.Medal of Honor recipientsOf the millions of men and women who have served in the U.S. armed forces, only about 3,400 have received the Medal of Honor, America's highest award for valor. Among those few are eight Virginia Tech alumni.Get Directions  See All Locations  Contact Virginia Tech  © 2023 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

In 1958, Virginia Tech became the first traditionally white southern college to graduate an African American, with the graduation of Cadet Charles Yates ’58.

Cadets gather outside Barracks No. 1, now Lane Hall, in 1957. In a move to expand educational opportunities at Virginia Tech, the board of visitors made participation in the Corps completely voluntary starting in 1964. However, the taking of ROTC continued to require Corps membership. Similar action had been taken the prior year at Texas A&M. The Vietnam War period saw unrest on campus outside the Corps ranks. In 1970, demonstrations were conducted with the aim of halting Corps drill. Cowgill and Williams Halls were occupied and over 100 arrested. Various other disorderly incidents occurred including the suspected arson of an on campus building. Civilian-Cadet relations were at an all time low. Throughout all of this, the Corps maintained discipline and high morale while at the same time the Pennsylvania Military College disappeared.The post Vietnam years saw the Corps numbers decline and reorganization to a two-battalion size regiment. In 1973, Virginia Tech was one of the first Corps of Cadets in the nation to enroll women, assigning them to L Squadron. In 1975, the first female cadet was assigned to the Band Company. In 1979, L Squadron was disbanded and female cadets integrated into the line companies. In 1981, the Cadet dormitories became coed. Naval ROTC was established in 1983. The cadet regiment expanded to a three-battalion structure in 1998. Today the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is one of only six senior military colleges outside the five federal military academies. Virginia Tech is one of only two large, public universities in the nation that maintains a full time Corps of Cadets. The other is Texas A&M.The Corps at Virginia Tech has seen many turbulent years and weathered them all. Since the Spanish American War the Corps has provided leadership in our nation’s times of need. Most recently, Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom saw nine Virginia Tech alumni killed, five of which were Corps alumni. The valor of our alumni is legendary, with seven Medal of Honor recipients, and 22 recipients of the nation’s second highest award for valor - the Distinguished Service Cross or Navy Cross. The Corps continues and always will because the spirit and devotion of its cadets and alumni will never waiver. Whenever the nation has called, the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets was ready to live up to the University motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve).Review the university's history, including student life through the years, biographies of the university's presidents, and a gallery of historic photos.The PylonsThe Pylons above War Memorial Chapel are etched with the names of every Virginia Tech student and graduate who died defending our nation’s freedom, beginning with those lost during World War I.

 In the spring of 1970, campus unrest was endemic in the United States. Across
the country, college students protested. They protested the war in Vietnam; they
protested the sometimes-harsh response to their criticism of the country; they
protested their lack of voice in the government. 
At Virginia Tech, the protests were mainly small, quiet affairs: sit-ins and
teach-ins. In late spring, though, the protests began to get more daring and
confrontational.
 The administration (under the leadership of President T. Marshall Hahn, Jr.) and
parts of the student body had been at odds for some time. Some of the students
wanted more direct participation in the University's governance, through
participation on the various councils and commissions (most notably the
University Council). The administration had denied these requests, and in general
had taken a hard line toward any disruption of university-sanctioned
activity.
In April, a student had been chastised for wearing an American flag as the seat
of his pants. In response, some students called for a number of changes in the
University's policies, and distributed a flier around
campus urging student unrest. This unrest was to culminate in a disruption of the
Corps of Cadets drill.

In mid-April, the student radicals made good their pledge; they disrupted the
ROTC drill on the Drillfield, and forced the Cadets to stop.
The administration took swift action. The ringleaders (those they were able to
identify) were suspended and a court injunction obtained to prevent them from
repeating the act. This succeeded in calming the campus, but only for a short
time.
In early May, four students were
killed by National Guardsmen during a demonstration at Kent State University
in Ohio. Outrage at this act rippled across the country, touching off more
protesting.
On the Virginia Tech campus, students were quick to react to the news of the
killings. The SGA urged the University to allow
students more freedom in pursuing their consciences in protest. More radical
elements of the student body, frustrated in their attempts to gain more
representation in the administration and angered by the Kent State incident,
chose a more extreme path. On May 12, a large body of students seized Williams
Hall.
The administration's response was again swift. The State Police were quickly
called in to manage the large crowd of students outside the building as well as
deal with the protesters inside.

At 6 a.m. on May 13, the State Police forced entry into Williams and began
rounding up the students inside. The first few were dragged out of the building;
the rest left peacefully. The protesters were herded into tractor trailors and
taken to Montgomery County jail.
The administration released a statement on the
incident to the media. Dr. Hahn was soon deluged with an outpouring of support
for his actions. Many people, wearied by the constant protesting and criticism of
the country, welcomed Dr. Hahn's quick, uncompromising actions. Thousands of
letters and telegrams poured into Blacksburg.
The students involved in the seizure, suspended and given twenty-four hours to
remove their belongings from campus, tried to get a court injunction against the
suspension, but failed. Their statement, issued after
their release from jail, tries to explain their intent and to refute some of the
administration's claims, particularly the finding of materials for a
firebomb.
In the end, the administration triumphed. Many students
found the protestors' methods distasteful, and not representative of the student
body. Several more protests occurred at Tech, but none were violent. The campus
soon settled back into the quiet pastoral life it had known.

his press conference release on the morning of May 13, 1970 to the news
media.Back to Introduction




The nation tumoil and tragedy of recent weeks deeply concern every citizen
especially those of us in higher education. The times require the highest degree
of sensitivity and understanding by all of us.

For more that a week, there has existed on this campus considerable student
unrest and the university has made every effort to be responsive and at the same
time to maintain its academic integrity. Not only have the University Council,
the Cabinet of the Faculty Senate, and the faculty of each of the colleges
expressed their confidence in the strength and flexibility of our structure of
university governance and shared responsibility, but also the structure has
demonstrated its ability to be used quickly, responsively, and responsibly.

The overwhelming majority of the students and faculty at this university are to
be commended for the high level of responsibility and sensitivity they have
displayed during the past week. Unfortunately, there is a small proportion of our
university community, and some outsiders, who are determined to close the
university. Any such action cannot be tolerated. All appropriate means will be
employed to protect individual rights and freedoms by maintaining the regular
functions of the university.

During the past few days, there have been a number of serious incidents,
including damage to university property, a series of potentially dangerous fires,
breaking and entering into a university building, and occupation of Cowgill Hill.
All of these problems have been dealt with through regular university channels,
and a number of disciplinary actions have been taken or are in process. Prior
planning and prompt action by university personnel largely have been responsible
for minimizing the damage from these incidents.

Handling these problems through regular university channels has provided a
moderating influence. At the same time, this had frustrated and intensified the
determination of a militant group determined to close down the university.

Last night, more than 100 students and outsiders seized Williams Hall,
barrricaded the doors, spent the night in the building, caused significant damage
within the building, and refused orders of a university official to vacate the
premises. Components for the manufacture of fire bombs were found in the
building.

While university precedures should be utilized as long as possible, anarchy must
be dealt with in appropriate manner. Consequently, highly-trained units of State
Police, skilled in non-violent restraining and control measures, were requested
to remove the occupying students and other individuals so that normal university
operations could be maintained. It is gratifying that this was possible without
injury to any individual. In addition, alternate classroom locations have been
provided until Williams Hall can be cleaned and utilized for classroom activity.

All students taken from the building were suspended from the university and
arrested. They have also been notified that they may pick up their personal
belongings on the campus and thereafter will be deemed trespassers. These are
strong and regrettable steps, but there was no alternative in order to maintain
public safety and to continue operations of the university.

State Police and other security personnel will be maintained on campus as long as
necessary to protect the safety and individual freedom of every member of the
university community. At the same time, I continue to be fully confident of the
strength of the university and seek the continued support of all citizens.

He was 78.“Bill guided Virginia Tech as it transitioned and matured as a research university. I had the pleasure of serving as professor and dean during his time of leadership, which I recall as dynamic and exciting,” said Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger.Lavery brought stability to the university following the years of explosive growth under President T. Marshall Hahn Jr. But, he ushered in rapid growth in other areas, complementing Hahn’s successes. He emphasized research, and expenditures in support of research totaled more than $70.2 million by fiscal year 1987, moving the university into the top 50 research institutions in the nation.He enhanced research opportunities by initiating the Corporate Research Center (CRC) and Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties (VTIP). During his 12-year term, the first two buildings were begun at the center and two more were planned.Under him the university made giant technological leaps. The CRC received an antenna to link Virginia Tech to the world via satellite, and the Extension division developed a series of 26 downlink sites throughout the state. Installation began on a new communication system for the campus, the university purchased a supercomputer, and the first proposal was developed for what later became the Blacksburg Electronic Village.Lavery also placed a high priority on alleviating shortages of classroom, laboratory, and office space, and during his term the total inventory of available space increased by 50.1 percent. A $108 million construction program during his presidency included additions to Newman Library and the War Memorial Gymnasium and construction of Johnston Student Center. Another $17.5 million funded a complex to house the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, which was established during his presidency and opened to students in 1980.Under his watch, the university introduced a core curriculum and added degree programs. The number of minority scholarships and fellowships grew, and students applied in record numbers. Faculty salaries moved from the bottom third to the top fourth among research universities.Lavery hired the university’s first vice president for development, Charles Forbes, who launched a campaign to raise $50 million — then raised more than $118 million. Large contributions during his presidency included gifts from John Lee Pratt of $11 million to support engineering and agricultural programs and Marion Bradley Via of $3 million to establish the Harvey W. Peters Research Center and $5 million each to support the departments of civil engineering and electrical engineering. Additionally, Robert B. Pamplin Sr. and Robert Pamplin Jr. gave $10 million to support the College of Business. Assets of the Virginia Tech Foundation grew from $6.2 million to $140.1 million during his term.Lavery also hired the university’s first woman vice president, Sandra Sullivan, vice president for student affairs.“Bill was a fine person … very caring and compassionate. He was the consummate ‘people person’ interested in others,” said Minnis Ridenour, who served as executive vice president under Lavery.“Bill Lavery was passionate about Virginia Tech from the very first day he arrived in the late 60s, and always promoted [Virginia] Tech to every constituency he could. He loved invitations to join our alumni reunion groups even in his retirement, and did so often,” said Tom Tillar, vice president for alumni affairs.Lavery joined the faculty at Virginia Tech in 1966 as director of administration for the Extension division before being tapped as vice president for finance in 1968. In 1973, he became executive vice president, and he was appointed president in 1974, effective Jan. 1, 1975.Born in Geneseo, N.Y., Lavery earned his bachelor’s degree from Michigan State University, his master’s in public administration from George Washington University, and his doctorate in extension administration from the University of Wisconsin.He began his professional career as a teacher and coach at Clarence Central High School in Clarence, N.Y., before serving two years in the Army. He began working for the federal Extension Service’s Division of Management Operations in 1956, where he remained until 1966.Lavery married the former Peggy Johnson of Pawnee City, Neb., in 1956, and the couple had four children.During his presidency, he received numerous honors and awards. Among them, the National Conference of Christians and Jews presented him with the Brotherhood Award, the governor of Virginia appointed him to serve on the Commission on Virginia’s Transportation in the 21st Century, United States President Ronald Reagan named him chair of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development, and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury appointed him to the National Savings Bond Committee, where he chaired the Higher Education Industry Campaign. In 1985, Xavier University in the Philippines presented him with an honorary doctorate.After stepping down Dec. 31, 1987, he continued to serve the university, first as honorary chancellor, then as the William B. Preston Professor of International Affairs. After his retirement on Aug. 1, 1991, he was named president emeritus. The university recognized his contributions by presenting him with the Ruffner Medal in 1993 and by dedicating the William E. Lavery Animal Health Research Center in his honor in 1995, the same year he was named an honorary alumnus of Virginia Tech. Additionally, the Class of 1997 named its class ring in his honor.Visitation at McCoy Funeral Home, Blacksburg, will be Thursday, Feb. 19 5–7:30 p.m. followed by a Rosary Service at 7:30 p.m. His life will be celebrated at a Funeral Mass, on Friday, Feb. 20, 11 a.m. at St. Mary’s Catholic Church, Old Mill Road, Blacksburg.

Nearly 20 years ago, Virginia Tech acquired the former Kentland plantation in a controversial land swap with developers. 

But Kentland is much more than quality farmland: Tech inherited a piece of history.

From American Indian villages to encampments of marauding Union troops, Kentland has seen it all.

Archaeologists have found evidence of several American Indian settlements on the property, including at least one large village. White explorers tracked through the property as early as 1671.

Frontiersman and hunter Adam Harman established the New River Valley's first recorded white settlement at present-day Kentland in the mid-1700s, the late Patricia Givens Johnson wrote in her book "Kentland at Whitethorne." When Indian bands attacked Harman and other settlers, they responded by erecting forts on the property.

Because of a natural ford in the New River, Kentland became the "gateway" to the west for white explorers before the "Great Road" opened, said local historian Jimmie Price.

James Randal Kent, a wealthy landowner and slaveholder, built the existing manor house around 1830. Following the Battle of Cloyd's Mountain in May 1864, Union troops ransacked the plantation's food stocks, freed slaves and threatened the manor house.

The property changed hands among Kent descendents during the next century, including Josephine Cowan Scrivenor's family.

"It was a great place to grow up," said 98-year-old Scrivenor. "I don't think you'd find a prettier piece of land."

Later owners tried unsuccessfully to locate everything from a brewery to a steel mill on the site when, in 1986, Tech made an offer they couldn't refuse.

Desperate for additional farmland, Tech secretly traded about 250 acres of research orchards in what would become Christiansburg's main shopping district for the 1,785-acre Kentland property. The developers on the other end of the swap - one of them a former Tech athletics official - quickly sold 40 acres of old university farms for $2.7 million. News of the swap sparked outrage.

Today, Tech raises cattle and grows apples, soybeans and a host of other crops at Kentland. More than 300 acres of the farm is registered as a historic district.

"It's hard to put a price on it for the educational programs it serves," said Dwight Paulette, Tech's farm coordinator. Between the property's size and diversity, Paulette added, "I think we came out ahead."

Johnson expressed similar sentiments in her book.

"The fact that the state now owns old Kentland has saved it as agriculture land," Johnson wrote. "It can be stated that whatever the public believed, or whatever was true, there is one undeniable fact. A factory belching smoke or gushing toxic chemicals into the river, which the people of the area had so feared, will not be built at beautiful old Kentland."Weather JournalBLACKSBURG, VA., JUNE 13 -- A somber Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, in commencement exercises at Virginia Tech, today publicly rebuked the overseers of the university for its yearlong athletics scandal and warned other state-supported institutions not to put sports ahead of academics.In the sternest speech of his 17-month-old administration, Baliles threatened to withhold the reappointment of any member of Tech's ruling Board of Visitors who does not promise to help restore the school's reputation, which has been tarnished by allegations of illegal recruiting, the bitter departure of two athletic directors and a $4 million debt in the university's sports program."We have glimpsed an ominous future, a future few of us ever thought possible," said Baliles, the featured speaker at Tech's 115th annual commencement exercises here."It is a future of misspent financial resources, of million-dollar coaching contracts and lavish expense accounts," the governor said. "It is a future that invites unethical conduct and humiliating publicity."It is a future this institution never dreamt of," he said to applause from the crowd of 27,000. "It is a future that Virginia Tech does not need."Baliles' address, which galvanized many of the most exuberant graduates into rapt attention -- they interrupted his 15-minute speech five times with applause -- reflected the governor's anger and disappointment over a spate of unfavorable publicity about Tech athletics, according to his aides. Baliles made no apologies for using the most festive occasion of the school year as the forum for a barbed sermon.Virginia Tech, whose 1987 graduating class of 5,000 includes 1,700 students from Northern Virginia, holds "tremendous potential" for enhancing its already considerable reputation as an engineering center, Baliles said at a news conference after his speech. But, he told reporters, "I don't want that clouded by a lot of bad publicity about athletics."In his speech, Baliles needled the university's overseers for falling prey to "a new set of ambitions . . . that, if allowed to grow unchecked, could easily compromise Virginia Tech's excellence and injure its dreams."These are ambitions not measured by breakthroughs in research, but by breaking records in gate receipts. These are ambitions not measured by the achievements of scholars, but by glory on the playing field. They are not the ambitions of Virginians who care about education and care about Virginia Tech."Baliles carefully avoided any criticism of Tech President William E. Lavery, who appeared pensive and pained by the harshness of the governor's remarks. Asked during the news conference to assess Lavery's performance during the past year, Baliles demurred, saying: "Leadership is a perception problem, and my perception was directed to the board. Let me hasten to add that Dr. Lavery has been good for this institution."Lavery later issued a terse statement saying that Baliles' speech was "right on target.""Graduation is a happy occasion and a celebration of the accomplishments of our faculty, students and parents," the statement said."Gov. Baliles' speech brought that out very well."Others in the university community were more emphatic."I told him I admire a man who doesn't pull any punches," said James P.

Gerald L. Baliles, in commencement exercises at Virginia Tech, today publicly rebuked the overseers of the university for its yearlong athletics scandal and warned other state-supported institutions not to put sports ahead of academics.In the sternest speech of his 17-month-old administration, Baliles threatened to withhold the reappointment of any member of Tech's ruling Board of Visitors who does not promise to help restore the school's reputation, which has been tarnished by allegations of illegal recruiting, the bitter departure of two athletic directors and a $4 million debt in the university's sports program."We have glimpsed an ominous future, a future few of us ever thought possible," said Baliles, the featured speaker at Tech's 115th annual commencement exercises here."It is a future of misspent financial resources, of million-dollar coaching contracts and lavish expense accounts," the governor said. "It is a future that invites unethical conduct and humiliating publicity."It is a future this institution never dreamt of," he said to applause from the crowd of 27,000. "It is a future that Virginia Tech does not need."Baliles' address, which galvanized many of the most exuberant graduates into rapt attention -- they interrupted his 15-minute speech five times with applause -- reflected the governor's anger and disappointment over a spate of unfavorable publicity about Tech athletics, according to his aides. Baliles made no apologies for using the most festive occasion of the school year as the forum for a barbed sermon.Virginia Tech, whose 1987 graduating class of 5,000 includes 1,700 students from Northern Virginia, holds "tremendous potential" for enhancing its already considerable reputation as an engineering center, Baliles said at a news conference after his speech. But, he told reporters, "I don't want that clouded by a lot of bad publicity about athletics."In his speech, Baliles needled the university's overseers for falling prey to "a new set of ambitions . . . that, if allowed to grow unchecked, could easily compromise Virginia Tech's excellence and injure its dreams."These are ambitions not measured by breakthroughs in research, but by breaking records in gate receipts. These are ambitions not measured by the achievements of scholars, but by glory on the playing field. They are not the ambitions of Virginians who care about education and care about Virginia Tech."Baliles carefully avoided any criticism of Tech President William E. Lavery, who appeared pensive and pained by the harshness of the governor's remarks. Asked during the news conference to assess Lavery's performance during the past year, Baliles demurred, saying: "Leadership is a perception problem, and my perception was directed to the board. Let me hasten to add that Dr. Lavery has been good for this institution."Lavery later issued a terse statement saying that Baliles' speech was "right on target.""Graduation is a happy occasion and a celebration of the accomplishments of our faculty, students and parents," the statement said."Gov. Baliles' speech brought that out very well."Others in the university community were more emphatic."I told him I admire a man who doesn't pull any punches," said James P. O'Brien Jr., president of the class of 1987, who shared the speakers platform with Baliles on the emerald-green playing field of Lane Stadium.Kathy Sevebeck, a Blacksburg resident graduating today with a master's degree in adult education, said she thought Baliles' speech was "extremely appropriate today, and here, and before this audience.""I don't think Tech's been putting education first for the past year -- we'd get things straightened out and in the right direction and then be back in the broil again," said Sevebeck, whose husband and son also attended Tech."The governor has a lot of courage to say what he said, because things have been dragging out," Sevebeck said."And what more appropriate place than a commencement, a new beginning . . . . "Baliles noted in his speech that because of the way the state college system is structured, Virginia governors have virtually no direct control over the management of the 15 state-supported institutions.However, governors do appoint members of the schools' boards of visitors, a prerogative that Baliles indicated he will exercise with great care in the future.The terms of at least two members of Tech's 13-member board expire soon, but Baliles said he has made no decision whether to reappoint those individuals."Something has happened here, something that could jeopardize this institution's long-held mission," Baliles told the crowd."This governor holds the boards accountable," he said."I expect problems to be solved, not prolonged. And I expect extracurricular activities to have a place -- and be kept in their place."The board of visitors conducted a three-month search for a successor to Hahn, only to find one who had been part of his administration since 1966. William Edward Lavery, who received the unanimous approval of the board, became the university’s 12th president on Jan. 1, 1975. Lavery had been executive vice president since 1973, preceded by five years as vice president for finance and two years as director of administration for the Extension division. Earlier, he had worked in administration for the federal Extension service.The new president brought stability to the university following the years of explosive growth under Hahn. But Lavery ushered in rapid growth in other areas, complementing Hahn’s successes. Taken together, the quarter-century of the Hahn/Lavery years changed the face—and the course—of the university.Economic conditions were not good when Lavery took office. The state had a $20 million shortfall in its projected revenues, and the governor was asking state agencies to cut back. But Virginia Tech soon entered a period of “good times” created by renewed public goodwill toward higher education and financial support made possible by an economic upturn.Lavery placed a high priority on alleviating shortages of classroom, laboratory, and office space, and during his term the total inventory of available space increased by 50.1 percent. The university adopted an “infill” concept for constructing buildings and additions, which won an award from the American Planning Association. A $108 million construction program included additions to Newman Library and the War Memorial Gymnasium and construction of Johnston Student Center and a $17.5 million complex to house the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, which opened to students in 1980.The president also emphasized research, and expenditures in support of research totaled more than $70.2 million by fiscal year 1987, moving Tech into the nation’s top 50 research universities. Lavery enhanced research opportunities by developing the Corporate Research Center on land purchased during Hahn’s administration. During his watch, the first two buildings were constructed and two more were planned. The center received an antenna to link Tech to the world via satellite, and the Extension division developed a series of 26 downlink sites throughout the state. Virginia Tech—particularly the College of Architecture and Urban Studies—also played a major role in developing the concept for Virginia’s Center for Innovative Technology.In other developments, President Ronald Reagan appointed Lavery chair of the USAID Board for International Food and Agricultural Development. The university opened the Cranwell International Center. Lavery hired the first vice president for development, who launched a capital campaign to raise $50 million—and then raised more than $118 million. Marion Bradley Via provided $3 million to establish the Harvey W. Peters Research Center and $5 million each to the departments of civil engineering and electrical engineering, and Robert B. Pamplin Sr. and Robert B. Pamplin Jr. gave the College of Business $10 million. Renovations began on The Grove to return it to its original use as the president’s home. The Highty-Tighties accepted women into its ranks, and the Marching Virginians  band was formed for civilians. The internationally acclaimed Audubon String Quartet moved permanently to the university. Engineering and computer science programs required their first-year students to buy personal computers, and the university purchased a supercomputer. Installation began on a new communication system for the campus, and the first proposal was developed for what later became the Blacksburg Electronic Village.Also, average SAT scores increased, a university core curriculum was introduced, library holdings grew from 1 million to 1.5 million volumes, the vice president for academic affairs was renamed provost, the number of minority scholarships and fellowships was increased, the first woman vice president was named, faculty salaries moved from the bottom third to the top fourth among research universities, additional degree programs were offered, the assets of the Virginia Tech Foundation grew from $7.4 million to $123.4 million, and students applied in record numbers.But the period of good times was not to last. A controversial land swap in 1986—Tech traded 247 acres of land for 1,700 acres needed for agricultural research—along with highly publicized problems with the athletic program created a furor across the commonwealth, even as the university took steps to correct its athletic nightmare.Lavery developed a reorganization plan for the Athletic Association. But with negative publicity continuing to swirl within and around the university, he announced his resignation on Oct. 16, 1987, effective Dec. 31, 1987, to prevent polarization of the campus. After stepping down, he continued to serve the university, first as honorary chancellor, then, after Oct. 1, 1988, as the William B. Preston Professor of International Affairs, and after his retirement on Aug. 1, 1991, as president emeritus. In 1993 the university presented him with the Ruffner Medal, and in 1995 it dedicated the William E. Lavery Animal Health Research Center in his honor.William Edward Lavery© 2017 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State UniversityCannot serve request to /content/history_unirel_vt_edu/en/corps/index.html on this serverOn October 1, 1872, Virginia Tech opened as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College. All students were cadets organized into a battalion of two companies with an enrollment of 132. The Commandant of Cadets was General James H. Lane, formerly the youngest general in the Army of Northern Virginia, who was wounded three times in combat. He worked to provide both the best education and the best military training in the state for his cadets based on his experience in the Civil War, as a student at VMI and UVA, and teacher at Florida State Seminary and North Carolina Military Institute. General Lane is considered the father of the Corps. He wrote the first cadet regulations and began a tradition of academic and military excellence.In 1963 work commenced on a corps museum, mainly through the leadership of the Sash and Saber Society and the cadet regimental staff. Today, the museum is temporarily located on the fourth floor of Newman Library, with plans to move it when construction of new corps residence halls on the Upper Quad are complete. Also in 1963, the corps’ crack drill team, Company C-15 of the Pershing Rifles, was renamed the Gregory Guard in honor of Earl D. Gregory, a Medal of Honor winner and later a Tech alumnus. In 1964 participation in the corps—two years participation had been required since 1923—became voluntary. Beginning in the fall 1968, freshmen entering the corps had a week of orientation into cadet life before the start of the school year.On Feb. 28, 1973, the board of visitors gave final approval to a plan to open the corps to women provided that the women would participate in the corps on the same 24-hour-a-day basis as male members. Women—the first to join were Deborah J. Noss and Cheryl A. Butler—were accepted into the corps, except for the regimental band, in September 1973, making the corps one of the first in the nation to admit women to its military program. The women initially comprised L Squadron. Women were accepted into the regimental band in 1975, with Stephanie Hahn and H. Elizabeth Thompson the first to join.The 25 women who joined the corps in 1973 lived in Monteith Hall, but in 1981 they were allowed to live in certain other residence halls but on different floors than male cadets. In 1990 they were fully integrated into each company area and began living on the same floors as the men.The corps recorded its smallest enrollment in modern times in 1976-77: 325, including 41 women. In an effort to revitalize it and to reverse the trend of declining enrollment, the board of visitors in early 1977 relaxed regulations governing corps enrollment and resignation. That fall, enrollment increased for the first time in 10 years to 330 members, including 48 women.In 1979 Selena S. Daughtrey became the first woman to command a company—F Company—comprised of both male and female cadets.The commander of the corps of cadets, a position established in 1895, is known as the regimental commander. In 1985 Derek A. Jeffries became the first African-American to hold the rank of regimental commander, and in 1987 Denise Shuster became the first woman to hold that position. The first African-American woman to serve in the position was Christina Royal, who was regimental commander in fall 2005. Beginning in 2000, one cadet served as regimental commander in the fall and a different cadet served in the spring, a move by the commandant’s office to give more cadets an opportunity to gain leadership experience.The Corps of Cadets Alumni Inc. was created in 1991 through the efforts of Henry Dekker (class of 1944) to save the corps, whose numbers had begun a downward spiral. The establishment of scholarships for cadets and a resurgence of national patriotism in 2001 helped the corps to attract new cadets. In 1992 the alumni organization initiated Corps Review, a newsletter that was expanded to a magazine in 2004 and targeted corps alumni.For the university’s 125th anniversary celebration in 1997, Col. F. Edward Schwabe Jr. of the commandant’s staff organized a commemorative walk to follow what he believed to be the trail that William Addison Caldwell, the first student to register at the institution, and his brother, Milton Caldwell, took from their home in the Sinking Creek section of Craig County to Blacksburg. About 10 members of the corps voluntarily participated in the walk along with two or three civilian students, a member of the classified staff, and an alumnus. The corps later adopted the march as a capstone event for freshman training, breaking it into two parts: the first half in the fall following the first phase of freshman training and the second half in the spring following the end of all freshman training. In 2005, alumnus Homer Hickam, whose book Rocket Boys was the basis for the popular movie October Sky and who wrote other popular novels, completed the spring march with the cadets.The Center for Leadership—later named the Rice Center for Leader Development and housed in the Pamplin College of Business—was established in 1996 to provide cadets with leadership development activities and a leadership minor. During the mid 1990s, the corps alumni organization set a “1000 in 2000” goal and initiated a major campaign to push the number of cadets to 1,000 by the turn of the century. The goal was not reached, but membership did increase. In 1996 the Corps of Cadets Alumni began backing publication of the multi-volume The Bugle’s Echo, a detailed history of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets by Col. Harry Downing Temple (class of 1934). The first volume of the history was issued that year, with five additional volumes following in later years. Temple spent 25 years conducting research for the history, which covers the years 1872-1934. He also produced in 1992 a pictorial history of the uniforms worn by Virginia Tech cadets: Donning the Blue and Gray. An expert on heraldry, he had earlier designed a coat of arms for the corps that was the first officially granted coat of arms from the Army to a unit outside the regular Army. Temple died in 2004 after making numerous contributions to corps history and the corps museum.Two cadet companies were organized at Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College during the first session of 1872-73. The corps of cadets was established as a permanent organization in the 1891-92 session, along with formation of the first battalion. An artillery battery was added in 1893. The first organization of the corps into a regiment came in 1923. That same year, President Julian Burruss reduced the four-year requirement for corps participation to two years. The first Air Force squadron (Squadron R) appeared in 1946. Batteries were eliminated in 1948. Squadrons were disbanded after 1947-48 but were re-established in 1956-57. Companies were created as the corps grew in size, then disbanded as enrollment shrunk, only to be reactivated when numbers increased. A chronological listing of corps units under their original names, according to the date of their first appearance, follows:A cornet band of 10 pieces was organized by Professor Albert Lugar during 1881-82 to furnish music for drills and parades. Known as the Glade Cornet Band, it contained both students and townspeople and did no marching. Because band members wore the initials of the band’s name on their hats—GCB—cadets began calling the group the Goose Creek Boys. In the spring 1892 a drum and bugle corps was organized to accompany cadets marching to and from mess.The first Band Company was organized in 1892 with 16 members and Cadet Clifford W. Anderson as its leader. The War Department issued 23 musical instruments to the college for the band’s use, and it made its first trip in 1893—to nearby Roanoke’s decennial celebration. On its second trip in 1893—to Norfolk—it accompanied the corps and participated in a competitive drill, which VPI won and was awarded two cannons, which were placed on the Upper Quad. The college also hired its first band director in 1893: James Patton Harvey.The origin of the band’s famed nickname, Highty-Tighties, has been surrounded in legend, but the true story is that the name came to be applied to the band slowly down through the years after 1919. A somewhat crude company yell was composed during the fall 1919 that contained the catch phrase “Highty-Tightie!” as the first line. As time passed and the band continued to use a modified version of the yell, other members of the corps applied the phrase to the band itself.Other popular legends surround the white citation cord that all band members wear. President Julian A. Burruss authorized white citation cords for members of the band in the fall 1935 at the same time he authorized white citation cords for honor companies.The band tried to enlist in the Spanish-American War in 1898 as a unit but was not allowed to do so. Most of the members resigned from college anyway and enlisted as bandsmen with the Second Virginia Regiment of Volunteer Infantry. The war ended while the regiment was still training in Florida.The band performed at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901 and played John Phillip Sousa’s “Thunderer March” as it passed him in review. Sousa had his own band play a march in return to acknowledge the VPI band’s salute to him. In 1902, as the band marched past President Theodore Roosevelt at the Charleston Exposition, he called them “the nation’s strength.” He reviewed them again in 1907 at the Jamestown Exposition.The band has achieved a great deal of fame through the years by winning scores of first place trophies in parade competitions. In 1953, 1957, and 1961 the band won first place in the presidential inaugural parade’s senior band-marching competition, a feat never achieved by any other band and possibly one reason why the competition is no longer held. The band also represented the Commonwealth of Virginia in presidential inaugural parades in 1973, 1977, and 1997 and played for President Reagan in Washington, D. C., during its centennial year in 1983. It performed for Reagan again in 1985 at a presidential dinner held as part of the Conservative Political Action Conference in D.C. It also marched in presidential inaugural parades in 1917, 1934, 1965, 1969, 1981, and 2005.Among its many other appearances, the regimental band helped open the New York World’s Fair in 1964, leading the opening day’s parade, and participated in the closing ceremonies of the 1982 World’s Fair in Knoxville, Tenn. In 1984 it performed for the 11th Annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., where guests included President Reagan and Vice President Bush. It has marched in the Thomas Edison Festival of Lights Parade in Ft. Myers, Fla; the Cherry Blossom Parade in Washington, D. C.; a Washington Redskins vs. Dallas Cowboys game at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington; numerous Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parades; and a number of Christmas and Thanksgiving Day parades in Atlanta and New York City.Although women joined the corps of cadets in 1973, they were not allowed into the Highty-Tighties, even though students from Radford College, the Women’s Division of VPI, had been allowed to play in the band on a temporary basis during World War II. In 1971 a women’s drill team—attired in white hot-pants; sleeveless, navy blue tops; white boots; and white tams—was organized to march with the band. In 1975 the decision was made to admit women into the band because of their outstanding record since joining the corps. Unlike other female corps members at the time, the female band members wore the same uniform as their male counterparts. The first female cadet to serve as drum major of the band was Vicki G. Saville, selected for the position in 1977, and the first African-American female cadet to serve as regimental band commander, Lisa Williams, followed in 1986In 1975 band alumni formed a non-profit corporation, Highty-Tighty Alumni Inc., with Charles O. Cornelison as president, “to promote and preserve the fraternal, educational, musical, and leadership qualities embodied in the Virginia Tech Regimental Band through constructive, organized efforts of its alumni.” Band membership that year reached an all-time low of 65 members. Nonetheless, the band—and the Gregory Guard—played a role in the nation’s bicentennial activities, with the Gregory Guard participating in the National Pershing Rifle Drill Team competition in New York City and the Highty-Tighties appearing in the Yorktown Festival.A regular organization for members of the corps, the Conrad Cavalry unit was organized in the fall 1971 by Kenneth T. Chappelle, who was its first commander, and made its debut May 23, 1972, on Montgomery County Day. The organization was named for Thomas N. Conrad, president of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Virginia Tech), 1882-86, who was an expert horseman. The unit, which was disbanded and then re-established in the late 1990s, uses horses and facilities of the privately owned Big Red Barn in Christiansburg. In fall 2007 the unit was developing a partnership with the 6th Virginia Cavalry re-enactors to use the re-enactors’ horses, which are trained for loud, high-stress environments, for military parades.Once known as Tech Company E-15 of the National Society of Pershing Rifles, the Gregory Guard was officially founded as a separate organization in 1963. A proficient, silent, armed drillteam, it is comprised of no more than 50 cadets who perform, usually in groups of three to 15, without vocal commands. The guard is named for Virginia Tech alumnus Earle D. Gregory, believed to be the first native Virginian to receive the Medal of Honor. In 1975 the precision marching unit placed first among 15 marching military units at the 22nd International Azalea Festival Parade in Norfolk, Va.From 1892-1937 cadet commissioned officers were selected from the senior class, sergeants from the junior class, and corporals from the sophomore class. In the 1937-38 session commissioned officers and sergeants were appointed from the senior class and corporals from the junior class. Since 1938 commissioned officers and sergeants have been appointed from the senior class, corporals from the junior class, and first-class privates from the sophomore class. The lance corporal rank, established in 1966 to recognize outstanding sophomore cadets who had already attained private first-class rank, is no longer bestowed.In the early years, rather than a regimental commander, corps adjutants assisted the commandant, who was the active commander of the corps. Those adjutants, listed below by the calendar year in which they served the major portion of their duties, were not necessarily the highest-ranking cadets.Return to the topThe first overall commander of the corps of cadets was appointed in 1895. Since that time, the regimental commander’s rank has been first lieutenant, captain, major, or colonel. Regimental commanders from 1895-1999 are listed below by the year in which they began serving. Beginning in 2000, two regimental commanders were selected, one in the fall and one in the spring. Beginning in 2000-01, the two regimental commanders are listed by the academic year in which they served.Return to the topThe first political (legislative) organization of the corps came with adoption of a constitution in June 1908. Cadets and civilians united under a single constitution on April 19, 1966, forming a Unified Student Body (now the Student Government Association), which nullified the cadet constitution. See Student Government AssociationCorps Presidents — The first president of the corps of cadets was elected for the 1908-09 session; the last was elected for the 1963-64 session. The president’s main function was to serve as chair of the cadet senate. The presidents, listed by the year in which they served most of their office, were the following:The Gray Jacket, a student publication, provides the first mention of an honor system in its October 1906 issue. The Honor System was established in 1908 by President Paul Barringer and was officially adopted by cadets during the 1908-09 session. An Honor Court, established in January 1935, tried both civilians and cadets. In fall 1939, the civilians established their own court. The board of visitors reorganized the honor system in 1973, with honor courts established in each academic college to try violations of lying, stealing, cheating, and failure to report a violation, but cadets continued to maintain their own Honor Court to try non-academic cases of violations of cadet regulations.Except for a period in 1879-81, a commandant has been over the corps of cadets since 1872, with two of them serving two non-consecutive terms. In 1966 the post began reporting to the dean of students. It has reported to the vice president for student affairs since 1968, when the first vice president for student affairs was named. Commandants:Return to the topThe board of visitors agreed to adopt ROTC at the college on Nov. 29, 1916. An Army infantry ROTC unit was organized on Jan. 5, 1917. Coast artillery and engineer units were added in 1919 but were disbanded after World War II. An Air Force ROTC unit was added in 1946. In 1952 the board of visitors directed that ROTC instruction be organized as an instructional department with no direct responsibilities for the corps of cadets. A Navy ROTC program became effective in 1983. Marine ROTC was established at the same time as and as a part of Navy ROTC. ROTC now operates under the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences umbrella.The original cadet uniform cost $17.25 and consisted of a cadet gray cap, jacket, and trousers trimmed with black. Other important changes since that time include the following:Designed by Col. Harry Downing Temple (class of 1934), who commanded the Army’s Institute of Heraldry 1961-66. Designated by the institute as an official coat-of-arms for the corps of cadets in 1966, the first time a coat-of-arms had ever been assigned by the Institute of Heraldry to a unit outside the regular Army, National Guard, or Army Reserve.For years, the Military Ball and the Military Brawl comprised Military Weekend, which is held during the winter (February) each year. The Military Ball was first held at the 1887 Commencement, was discontinued after 1890, was revived in 1940 by Scabbard & Blade, and continues today. It has also been known as the Corps Dance. The Military Brawl was known as the Corps Minstrel until 1964, when the name was changed to the Corps Variety Show. The shows commenced in 1919, were discontinued after 1931, were revived in 1956, and were discontinued in the early 2000s. The Military Brawl featured skits by cadet organizations, cadet musical performances, and a slide show. Beginning on the Thursday before the Saturday evening ball, the corps now hosts a leadership conference, and visiting cadets stay for the senior banquet that precedes the ball. Military Weekend concludes with “Silver Taps” played by regimental buglers standing among the Pylons and a fireworks display sponsored by the Sash and Saber Society.Various cannons have been used off and on for years at Virginia Tech, and in the 1960s one industrious student formally proposed to the student governing body that a cannon be acquired to fire at football games. The proposal was approved but went no further. About the same time, cadets Alton B. “Butch” Harper Jr. and Homer Hadley “Sonny” Hickam made a pact at a traditional Thanksgiving Day game with then-archrival VMI that they would build a cannon for Virginia Tech (then known as VPI) to outblast VMI's “Little John” and to halt the VMI Keydets from yelling “Where’s your cannon?”Harper and Hickam collected materials (members of the corps contributed brass) and used a mold created in one of the engineering departments from Civil War-style plans to make their cannon. The canon was fired for the first time on Nov. 23, 1963, the day after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, to honor him—and it was named “Skipper” because Kennedy had been the skipper of a PT-boat.The canon was fired for the first time at a football game on Thanksgiving Day 1963 during the annual VMI game. At its first firing, the eager cadets tripled the charge, shaking the glass in the press-box windows of Roanoke's Victory Stadium. Today, cadets fire Skipper from outside Lane Stadium when the football team enters the field and when it scores and for other notable occasions.Each Memorial Day during the first years of the university, when it was known as Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, the corps marched to Montgomery White Sulphur Springs, 12-15 miles away, to honor the Confederate soldiers buried there, returning to campus the same day.  In 1875 parts of the corps’ two companies formed one company for the long march, while the remaining students rode to the ceremony, prompting a comment from a Gen. Preston that "it was 'd_____ poor militia that had to be hauled about in ambulances." Since then, the corps of cadets has taken numerous other trips as a unit, although such trips were more frequent in earlier days. The first out-of-state trip by the corps was to the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, N.Y., in June 1901. The cadets, quartered in tents at the fair, participated in drills and parades. They returned to campus for commencement after nine days away from the college. The second major trip—to an exposition in Charleston, S.C.—occurred in April 1902. There, President Theodore Roosevelt reviewed the corps. Two special trains were required in the spring 1904 when a party of 554 students, faculty members, and guests left Christiansburg to attend the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (St. Louis World’s Fair). The corps spent a week in St. Louis, living in a camp located at the fair grounds. (See also Band Company and Gregory Guard.)Return to the topFirst Student

By Lt. Col. Dave Williams ‘79, U.S. Army (retired)I ask myself this question — how are we doing with recuriting? — quite frequently, and others ask me the same thing quite frequently. I usually resort to my line that I borrowed from former Commandant of Cadets Lt. Gen. Howard Lane many years ago: “We have done well, and we can do better.”The reason I fall back to this is that you can drive yourself crazy chasing numbers and trying to build trend lines that may or may not actually exist. Variables that are well beyond the control of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets make recruiting predictions a guessing game.Each year, the applicant pool for Virginia Tech sets, or at least moves the needle, on the numbers of students offered admission to the university. That one variable can enormously help or hurt all the good work of the cadets and alumni recruiters. Mix in variables such as the effectiveness of our printed material, our website, the number of college fairs we can reach, even the number of conversations we have with potential cadets, and you have the formula for nothing more than a hazy picture of the future. The best advice I can share with alumni recruiters is stick to it and keep telling the Corps’ story. As we have discussed in this column before, every year stands separate and alone. My friend Charlie Cornelison was right all those years ago when he likened recruiting to the Huckleberry — the train pulls in at mid-August and drops off the new cadet class and then leaves Blacksburg completely empty. It is up to the Corps, the commandant’s professional recruiting staff, and alumni recruiters to fill those cars between August and the deadline for regular decision admissions, which is Jan. 15, 2019 – five months!This year, Virginia Tech’s Admissions Office asked Corps alumni for help with college fairs with a new electronic format for signing up. If you were paying attention to your email, you may have seen a “tail wag” from the Corps’ canine ambassador Growley II headlining the need for alumni recruiters.The campaign was highly effective. In a matter of a few weeks, the number of Corps alumni supporting college fairs far exceeded the volunteer level of individual alumni chapters, and this semester we helped with more college fairs in one semester than we did in the entire previous year. Keep your eyes open for future emails as the spring out-of-state college fair season will begin to heat up after the first of the year.My thanks to all of you who faithfully tell the Corps’ story year after year. To those of you who want to get involved, please do so. So how did we do this year? We had 397 freshman cadets and a Corps that started the year at an enrollment of 1,127 — the largest the university has seen since 1966. We did well, very well.Get Directions  See All Locations  Contact Virginia Tech  © 2020 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. All rights reserved.Cannot serve request to /content/vtnews_vt_edu/en/articles/2019/08/corps-growth.html on this serverAugust 2, 2019When Matt Mabutas puts on his Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets uniform, he thinks of all those who did the same before him.“I feel extremely humbled,” said the rising sophomore who is majoring in mechanical engineering in the College of Engineering, minoring in leadership studies in the corps, and part of the Air Force ROTC. “The people who put this uniform on before I did, they were amazing. They built the corps into what it is now.”Mabutas may have been speaking figuratively. But to a great degree, what he said is literally true.This month, Mabutas will be among those cadets working summer orientation to explain the corps experience to the families of more than 400 first-year students, whose arrival will boost the corps’ enrollment over 1,100. It’s a far cry from the mid-1990s when, with enrollment below 500 overall, the program’s very future seemed in question. The corps’ inspiring resurgence is a credit to the perseverance and generosity of alumni who, decades ago, recognized the tenuous position the program was in and decided to do all they could to help.Together, they have raised tens of millions toward cadet scholarships and served as volunteers to help ensure the program’s future. Today, roughly 80 percent of cadets receive Emerging Leader Scholarships, and ongoing fundraising may one day raise that to 100 percent. Meanwhile, philanthropy is making possible a new Corps Leadership and Military Science Building near Lane Hall, on the Upper Quad of Virginia Tech’s Blacksburg campus. Approved by the Board of Visitors in June, the $52-million, 75,500-square-foot building will bring together corps and ROTC programs now dispersed across several buildings. At the same meeting, the board also approved construction of a new residence hall for cadets, the third since 2015, which will allow the program’s enrollment to reach 1,400.“The support of the university president, university leadership, and the Board of Visitors for these two initiatives is a strong reaffirmation for the mission of the corps and its relationship to a university that was built on the foundation of service to others,” said Commandant of Cadets Maj. Gen. Randal Fullhart.David Lowe, a retired telecommunications executive who earned his business management degree in 1963 and serves on the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Alumni Board, agreed.“I think it’s wonderful to see the administration recognizing the value of the corps and affirming that through their decisions,” he said. “Every day, every person who visits campus, they see young men and women in uniform and understand the sacrifices they are making or are prepared to make. It is the ever-present personification of our university motto Ut Prosim,” (That I May Serve).Recent years have seen a dramatic expansion in the number of living-learning communities Virginia Tech offers its undergraduates through the Student Affairs. Many positive results have been shown from participating. First-year students in living-learning communities have higher GPAs, fewer conduct referrals, and higher rates of mentorship by faculty. Among the newer communities Virginia Tech has introduced are ones dedicated to arts and creativity, culture and identity, entrepreneurship, languages and global learning, and personal growth.The oldest one offered, by far, is the Corps of Cadets, which dates back to the university’s founding in 1872.“The Corps of Cadets exemplifies Virginia Tech’s foundational traditions and values, especially the spirit of service, something appreciated by all Hokies,” said Virginia Tech President Tim Sands, who commissioned a Gallup survey that found students at the university ranked higher in well-being and engagement than their peers nationally. “Alumni tell us their participation in the corps is one of the defining experiences of their lives. Robust living-learning communities, like the corps, contribute a great deal to the unique Virginia Tech experience. Our students are more likely to thrive on campus, and the benefits continue in their personal and professional lives long after graduation.”Being a cadet is an immersive, four-year experience designed to hone leadership skills that can be applied in careers in or out of the military. With its Corps of Cadets program, Virginia Tech is among the nation’s six senior military colleges. In a typical year, roughly 70 percent of graduating cadets earn commissions in either the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marines. While a majority of cadets are members of ROTC programs, a significant percentage choose the Citizen-Leader Track, which allows them to benefit from the corps experience without a military obligation after graduation.One such student is Viviana Pazos, a rising sophomore majoring in human nutrition, foods, and exercise in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Like many cadets, she said her first-year experience wasn’t easy as she adjusted to a new lifestyle and learned to overcome challenges, but it was highly rewarding.“In retrospect, being a freshman cadet was challenging, but when you finish you are a better person than when you started,” Pazos said. “You’re strong and more prepared to take on future challenges.”Corps alumnus Denny Cochrane earned his bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering in 1970. He served 30 years in the military and from 1996-2000 commanded the Army’s ROTC program at Virginia Tech. During that time, he was part of the effort to put the corps on a more solid footing by engaging alumni to support the program to greater degree. He’s stayed deeply involved, and is a member of the executive committee of the alumni board for the corps.“Alumni said, ‘We’re not going to let the corps die,’” Cochrane said, thinking back to the mid-1990s. “We launched a campaign to engage alumni to support the Emerging Leaders Scholarship program. Once we got that going, the goal was growing the corps to 1,000 cadets.”With more than 1,100 cadets enrolled for 2019-20, and the program poised to grow to 1,400 in the coming years, that effort clearly made a difference. Cochrane said the corps experience has always had a great deal to offer aspiring leaders, and the program’s resurgence has been extremely fulfilling to see.“The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is special,” he said. “It is an academic multiplier. We get a great education here, but we also get the leadership training through the corps, ROTC, and all the other experiences on and off campus. It makes the academic credentials even more powerful, and we have a national reputation for producing outstanding leaders.”His fellow alumnus, Lowe, was equally gratified to see the strong position of today’s corps.“I think the initiatives and involvement of the corps have even more meaning and value today than they did in my day as a cadet,” he said. “As I get to know the young men and women who are in the corps, it reaffirms my confidence in the future of this country.”

Fact file: Deadliest shootings in U.S.Massacre at Virginia Tech
      An American-born man who’d pledged allegiance to ISIS gunned down 49 people early Sunday at a gay nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest mass shooting in the United States and the nation’s worst terror attack since 9/11, authorities said.
  
Read the latest developments

      * The gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce, Florida, was interviewed by the FBI in 2013 and 2014 but was not found to be a threat, the FBI said.

      * Mateen called 911 during the attack to pledge allegiance to ISIS and mentioned the Boston Marathon bombers, according to a U.S. official.
  
      * Orlando police shot and killed Mateen.
  
      *  Mateen’s ex-wife said she thinks he was mentally ill.
  
      Mateen carried an assault rifle and a pistol into the packed Pulse club about 2 a.m. Sunday and started shooting, killing 49 people and wounding at least 53, officials said. 
  
      After a standoff of about three hours, while people trapped inside the club desperately called and messaged friends and relatives, police crashed into the building with an armored vehicle and stun grenades and killed Mateen.
  
Live updates: Latest news on Orlando shootings

      “It appears he was organized and well-prepared,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina said early Sunday. Authorities said they haven’t found any accomplices.
  
      There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack on jihadi forums, but ISIS sympathizers have reacted by praising the attack on pro-Islamic State forums.
  
      “We know enough to say this was an act of terror and act of hate,” President Obama said in an address to the nation from the White House. 
  
      While the violence could have hit any American community, “This is an especially heartbreaking day for our friends who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,” he said.
  
President Obama: 'This was an act of terror and hate'

Timeline of Orlando nightclub shooting

      Omar Mir Seddique Mateen was born in 1986 in New York. Most recently he lived in Fort Pierce, about 120 miles southeast of Orlando. Fearing explosives, police evacuated about 200 people from the apartment complex where he lived while they looked through his residence for evidence.
  
      Mateen’s parents, who are from Afghanistan, said he’d expressed outrage after seeing two men kiss in Miami, but they didn’t consider him particularly religious and didn’t know of any connection he had to ISIS.
  
      He was married in 2009 to a woman originally from Uzbekistan, according to the marriage license, but he filed documents to end the marriage in 2011.
  
      Sitora Yusufiy, interviewed by CNN in Boulder, Colorado, said she and Mateen were together about four months, though it took a long time to complete the divorce because they lived in different parts of the country after separating.
  
      Mateen was a normal husband at the beginning of their marriage but started abusing her after a few months, she said. She said Mateen was bipolar, although he was not formally diagnosed.  She also said Mateen had a history with steroids.  He was religious but she said she doesn’t think his religion played in to the attack.
  
      Mateen had worked since 2007 as a security officer at G4S Secure Solutions, one of the world’s largest private security companies.
  
      A message posted in Arabic on a dark web site associated with the ISIS news agency Amaq said “the armed attack that targeted a gay night club in the city of Orlando in the American state of Florida and that bore more than a 100 killed and wounded was carried out by an Islamic state fighter.”
  
      But CNN’s Salma Abdelaziz, who translated the message and closely monitors ISIS messaging, cautioned about taking the message at face value. 
  
      She said the language is inconsistent with previous ISIS announcements and that the Arabic word for gay was used rather than an epithet normally used by ISIS. Also, there was no claim that the attack was directed, just an after-the-fact claim the gunman was an ISIS fighter, she said.
  
      At a Sunday afternoon news briefing, FBI Assistant Special Agent Ronald Hopper said the agency was aware of Mateen. The FBI interviewed him in 2013 and 2014 after he expressed sympathy for a suicide bomber, Hopper said.
  
       “Those interviews turned out to be inconclusive, so there was nothing to keep the investigation going,” Hopper said.
  
      Mateen was not under investigation at the time of Sunday’s shooting and was not under surveillance, Hopper said.
  
      In the past two weeks Mateen legally purchased a Glock pistol and a long gun, ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Trevor Velinor told reporters.
  
       It’s not known if those weapons were used in the attack.
  
      “He is not a prohibited person. They can legally walk into a gun dealership and acquire and purchase firearms. He did so. And he did so within the last week or so,” Velinor said. 
  
      Pulse describes itself as “the hottest gay bar” in the heart of Orlando. Hours before the shooting, the club urged partygoers to attend its “Latin flavor” event Saturday night.  The club is a vast, open space that was hosting more than 300 patrons late Saturday and into Sunday morning.
  
      People inside the cavernous nightclub described a scene of panic made more confusing by the loud music and darkness.
  
      “At first it sounded like it was part of the show because there was an event going on and we were all having a good time,” clubgoer Andy Moss said. “But once people started screaming and shots just keep ringing out, you know that it’s not a show anymore.”
  
      Christopher Hansen said he was getting a drink at the bar about 2 a.m. when he “just saw bodies going down.” He heard gunshots, “just one after another after another.”
  
      The gunshots went on for so long that the shooting “could have lasted a whole song,” he said.
  
      When the shots erupted, Hansen hit the ground, crawling on his elbows and knees, before he spotted a man who had been shot. 
  
      “I took my bandana off and shoved it in the hole in his back,” Hansen said, adding that he saw another woman who appeared to be shot in the arm.
  
      Survivors provided CNN with dramatic accounts of how they avoided death. One person hiding in the bathroom covered herself with bodies to protect herself. Some entertainers hid in a dressing room when the shooting started and escaped the building by crawling out when police removed the air conditioning unit.
  
      One of the bartenders said she hid under the glass bar.  Police came in and said, “If you are alive, raise your hand.”  Then police got her and others out.  
  
      After the initial shooting, police surrounded the club while Mateen was inside with clubgoers hiding in bathrooms and other parts of the building. People inside the club were communicating on their phones with law enforcement from that time until around 5 a.m., when authorities used an armored vehicle to break down the door of the building. 
  
      Thirty-nine people and Mateen were pronounced dead at the scene, with two bodies found in the parking lot, Mayor Buddy Dyer said. Eleven people were taken to hospitals and pronounced dead there, he said.
  
      The City of Orlando is posting names of the deceased on a website after next of kin are notified. The youngest person among the first seven named, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, was 20 years old. 
  
      Forty-three of the wounded people were patients on Sunday afternoon at Orlando Regional Medical Center, a hospital spokesperson said, with 26 operations being performed. 
  
Blood donors rush to help in Orlando

      Before Sunday, the deadliest shootings in U.S. history were at Virginia Tech in 2007 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, with 32 and 27 killed. Fourteen people were killed December 2 in an attack in San Berardino, California.

Worst mass shootings in U.S.

      National media attention was already focused on Orlando over the weekend because of Friday night’s fatal shooting of Christina Grimmie while she signed autographs after a show. She was an up-and-coming singer who had appeared on NBC’s “The Voice.” Her shooter then killed himself. The Pulse shooting happened only a few miles from the Plaza Live theater, where Grimmie was killed.
  
      Dyer, the mayor, called for the city to come together. “We need to support each other. We need to love each other. And we will not be defined by a hateful shooter,” he said.
  
      President Obama called for flags to be lowered to half staff and Florida Gov. Rick Scott called for a moment of silence across the nation at 6 p.m. Sunday. States of emergency were declared for the city of Orlando and for Orange County.
  
      Also on Sunday, authorities in West Hollywood, California, arrested 20-year-old James Wesley Howell. They said they found an arsenal in his car that included, three assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, ammunition and a five-gallon bucket with chemicals that could be used to create an explosive device, officials said.  At 5 a.m. PT, police got a call about a prowler and found Howell, who told authorities he was looking for a friend to attend the LA Pride festival. 
  
      There was no indication the arrest was related to the Orlando attack.

America’s deadliest mass shootings

      Eleven Orlando police officers and three sheriff’s deputies who exchanged gunfire with the suspect will be temporarily relieved of duty pending an investigation.
  
      One officer suffered an eye injury when a bullet struck his Kevlar helmet, said Danny Banks, special agent in charge of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Orlando bureau. The helmet saved the officer’s life, Banks said. 
  
Orlando shooting sparks gun control, language debates

      The attacks were denounced on Sunday by numerous groups, including the Vatican, Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
  
Muslim leader to ISIS: 'You do not speak for us'

      “This is a hate crime, plain and simple,” CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper said. “We condemn it in the strongest possible terms.” 
  
      Nadine Smith of Equality Florida said groups are planning vigils around the nation. “It has just been a devastating day but people are starting to rally,” she said.
  
      Barbara Poma, owner of the Orlando nightclub Pulse, released the following statement on Sunday:
  
      “Like everyone in the country, I am devastated about the horrific events that have taken place today. Pulse, and the men and women who work there, have been my family for nearly 15 years. From the beginning, Pulse has served as a place of love and acceptance for the LGBTQ community. I want to express my profound sadness and condolences to all who have lost loved ones. Please know that my grief and heart are with you.”

CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Updated 4:06 AM ET, Sun June 12, 2016  (CNN)Gunfire erupted at a nightclub in Orlando early Sunday, with multiple injuries reported, Florida authorities said.  "Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running,"  the club posted on its Facebook page. Orlando police warned residents to stay away from the area. This video can not be playedHow the horror unfolded - in two minutes At least 59 people have been killed and another 527 injured in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert.A gunman, named as 64-year-old Nevada resident Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival attended by 22,000. He killed himself as police stormed the room where 10 guns were found.Investigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State.In an address from the White House, President Donald Trump described the attack as "pure evil".He praised the efforts of the emergency services, saying their "miraculous" speed saved lives, and announced he would be visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday. With First Lady Melania by his side, he later observed a moment of silence on the White House lawn.This video can not be playedA police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's roomThe final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out - hundreds of shots, witnesses say. That was late on Sunday night - 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday).Hundreds of concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point. "One man had blood all over him and that's when I knew something was seriously wrong," Mike Thompson from London, told the BBC. "People were running and there was chaos."Concert-goer Mike McGarry, who survived, told Reuters he lay on top of his children when the shots rang out."They're 20, I'm 53. I lived a good life," he said.Many hotels on the Las Vegas strip close to the scene were placed on police lockdown and parts of Las Vegas Boulevard were shut.Aldean, who was rushed off-stage, shared his reaction  on Instagram. "Tonight has been beyond horrific," he wrote.Las Vegas police say the number of people injured stands at 515. Stephen Paddock, from a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite north-east of Las Vegas, booked into the hotel on 28 September, police say.His motives for carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history remain a mystery. Some investigators have suggested psychological issues, but there is no confirmation of this. His brother, Eric, is dumbfounded that he acted this way.This video can not be playedEric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooterLas Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo described the shooting as a "lone wolf" attack. "We have no idea what his belief system was," he said. So-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed to be behind the attack, saying that Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago. But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. FBI Special Agent Aaron Rouse told a news conference: "We have determined at this point no connection to an international terrorist organisation."IS's claim of responsibility for the Las Vegas attack is very unusual in that the perpetrator's profile does not fit that of supporters or "soldiers" that the group has claimed in the past, writes Mina al-Lami, who monitors jihadist groups for the BBC.If true, his suicide would be deemed wholly "un-Islamic", she adds.Jihadist suicides involve the assailant blowing himself up in order to kill those around him.The investigation continues to gather pace, with searches at Paddock's Mesquite home, where more weapons were found, and a second property. Paddock lived in Mesquite with Marilou Danley. Police have interviewed her but say she does not appear to have been involved as she was out of the country. They are hoping to speak to her again.Police say he used some of her identity documents to check in to the Mandalay Bay.The authorities have yet to confirm the identities of any of the 58 killed. Jordan McIldoon, 23, from British Columbia in Canada, has been identified as a victim of the attack by CBC News.A nurse, Sonny Melton, of Big Sandy, Tennessee, has been named as another victim by The Jackson Sun newspaper.In a Facebook post, his wife, Dr Heather Gulish Melton, said she "lost my true love and knight in shining armor. I appreciate the prayers but I just need some time."An off-duty Las Vegas police officer was another of those who died. By the BBC's James Cook in Las VegasThe scenes which played out in this stunned city were at once frantically urgent and wearily familiar.When gunfire rings out, Americans know the drill. Run.They fled from a gunman who left a city in chaos.For a time, Las Vegas looked and felt like a war zone. Hospitals were overwhelmed. There were not enough ambulances. A plea for blood donations echoed across the airwaves.And now the mourning, the relief, the tears, the elation, the grief and a hundred other emotions are barely beginning.Doctors are still battling to save lives.For a Western democracy, the United States has seen an astonishing amount of horror like this.But even for this country what happened here is carnage on a different scale.America's mass shooting disease now feels like a plague.Nevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States.People are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as a gun-owner.Background checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately.Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, called for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack.  Her husband Mark Kelly read out a joint statement on the steps of the Capitol saying thoughts and prayers from the White House were not enough to stop the next shooting.

Columbine. Virginia Tech. University of Texas. Sandy Hook. America’s terrible history of school shootings is a list whose members can’t be named alone. Talk about any single one, and the others always hover on the periphery. But one name rarely gets mentioned among the others, the oldest and deadliest school massacre in U.S. history: the Bath School bombing.In 1927, Bath was a rural village of 300 people despite its location ten miles from Lansing, the state capital. The local institute of learning was Bath Consolidated School, built only five years earlier to replace the scattered one-room schools of the surrounding farmland. It had 314 students from around the region, many the sons and daughters of farmers. Some students were bused in, and all took classes with their peers over the course of elementary and high school.May 18 was the last day of classes for students that year, but at 8:45 the north wing of the three-story structure exploded with such force that the boom was heard miles away.“We knew it came from Bath, but we didn’t know what it was or anything, so we jumped in the old car and drove as fast as we could to see what it was,” Irene Dunham told the Lansing State Journal. The centenarian is the oldest living survivor. She was 19 at the time, a senior about to finish her last year—and stayed home that morning due to a sore throat.“There was a pile of children about five or six under the roof and some of them had arms sticking out, some had legs, and some just their heads sticking out. They were unrecognizable because they were covered with dust, plaster and blood,” wrote local author Monty J. Ellsworth in his 1927 account, The Bath School Disaster. “It is a miracle that many parents didn’t lose their minds before the task of getting their children out of the ruins was completed. It was between five and six o’clock that evening before the last child was taken out.”As community members rushed to help after the explosion, getting rope to lift up the collapsed roof and pull the students and teachers from the rubble, a member of the school board named Andrew Kehoe drove up to the site. Kehoe stepped out of his truck filled with dynamite and shrapnel, aimed his rifle at it, and fired. The ensuing explosion killed the school superintendent, several other bystanders, and Kehoe himself.In addition to the hundreds of pounds of explosives that had set off the blast at the school, fire department personnel and police officers found another 500 pounds of unexploded pyrotol dynamite rigged up around the school’s basement, along with a container of gasoline that may have been placed there to cause a fire if the dynamite failed. Kehoe had also burned his farmhouse and killed his wife and two horses; their bodies were discovered at the farm, along with a sign attached to the property fence that read, “Criminals are made, not born.” Prior to the massacre, Kehoe had been just another community member. He lived with his wife, Nellie, on a farm, and held the position of treasurer on the Bath school board. The one-time electrician had a large supply of explosives—World War I surplus—bought from the government that he used to help farmers remove tree stumps. There’d been several unusual incidents prior to the bombing: Kehoe killed his neighbor’s dog, beat one of his horses to death, and argued with members of the school board over the cost of ongoing taxes for the consolidated school. But it had never been anything so alarming that other villagers had any suspicion of what was coming.“A lot of the stupid things he did were just stupid things people did,” says Arnie Bernstein, the author of Bath Massacre: America’s First School Bombing.In the end 44 people died, 38 of them students. It wasn’t the first bombing in the country’s history—at least eight were killed during the Haymarket Square rally in Chicago in 1886, and 30 when a bomb exploded in Manhattan in 1920. But none had been so deadly as this, or affected so many children.Newspapers rushed to make sense of the tragedy. They called Kehoe insane, demented, a madman. Although there was little understanding of mental illness at that point, the media still tried to find reasons for the bombing. “He was notified last June that the mortgage on his farm would be foreclosed, and that may have been the circumstance that started the clockwork of anarchy and madness in his brain,” claimed the New York Times, while the Boston Daily Globe suggested that two head injuries may have disrupted his thinking.“At the conclusion of the inquest, it says he was of rational mind the whole time,” Bernstein says. “It does take a rational mind to plan all that out. The reality is there’s no why.”In the immediate aftermath of the bombing, the community was inundated with well wishes and donations—as well as rubbernecking tourists. As funerals were held in homes around Bath over the weekend, as many as 50,000 people drove through the town, causing massive traffic jams. But almost as quickly as the media frenzy built up, it abruptly ceased—in part because of Charles Lindbergh’s successful first-ever nonstop transatlantic flight two days after the bombing. Combined with the lack of true mass media, the Bath bombing quickly fell out of the news cycle.“In a way that’s probably the best thing that could happen for the town, because it gave them time to mourn and heal,” Bernstein says.Within a year, the school had been repaired, and classes moved from local stores back to the schoolhouse. The school remained in place until the 1970s, when it was torn down and replaced by a memorial park. In the center of the park stands the school’s cupola, exactly where it would have been on the school. For Bernstein, it’s a place of quiet and peacefulness, a fitting tribute to the students and community members who died.“In the face of horror we discover how decent we are,” Bernstein says. “That, to me, is the beauty of Bath.”Get the latest History stories in your inbox?Click to visit our Privacy Statement.

          With no federal child care deal in sight, some states are acting to ensure child care programs don’t have to close once pandemic relief funding runs out.For more information on this topic, use this form to reach NCSL staff.The January/February issue sizes up the top issues that legislators will face in 2019, reports on the crisis in maternity care in the U.S., reviews the challenges of the upcoming census, looks at efforts to keep drinking water clean and dives into the ins and outs of accrual budgeting.
          Current IssueIn the wake of several campus shootings, the most deadly being the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech University, states are considering legislation about whether or not to permit guns on college campuses. For some, these events point to a need to ease existing firearm regulations and allow concealed weapons on campuses. Others see the solution in tightening restrictions to keep guns off campuses.In 2017, two states passed legislation to allow students and faculty to carry guns on college campuses, Arkansas and Georgia. Over the last five years, campus safety legislation has been a hot issue across the country. In 2013, at least 19 states introduced legislation to allow concealed carry on campus in some regard and in the 2014 legislative session, at least 14 states introduced similar legislation. Tennessee passed a bill in 2016, which permits higher education faculty to carry handguns after notifying local law enforcement. In 2015, Texas became the eigth state to allow concealed carry weapons on college campuses. In December 2016, Governor Kasich of Ohio signed into law SB 199 which lifts the ban on firearms on college campuses and leaves the decision to individual institutions. On the other hand, recent shootings also have encouraged some legislators to strengthen existing firearm regulations. In 2014, five states introduced legislation to prohibit concealed carry weapons on campus. None of these bills passed.All 50 states allow citizens to carry concealed weapons if they meet certain state requirements. Currently, there are 16 states that ban carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus: California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina and Wyoming.In 23 states the decision to ban or allow concealed carry weapons on campuses is made by each college or university individually: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.Because of  recent state legislation and court rulings, 10 states now have provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public postsecondary campuses. These states are Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. Not included in above list, Tennessee allows faculty members with licenses to carry weapons on campus but the law does not extend to students or the general public. Utah remains the only state to have statute specifically naming public colleges and universities as public entities that do not have the authority to ban concealed carry, and thus, all 10 public institutions in Utah allow concealed weapons on their property. Recently passed Kansas legislation creates a provision that colleges and universities cannot prohibit concealed carry unless a building has "adequate security measures." Governing boards of the institutions, however, may still request an exemption to prohibit for up to four years. Wisconsin legislation creates a provision that colleges and universities must allow concealed carry on campus grounds. Campuses can, however, prohibit weapons from campus buildings if signs are posted at every entrance explicitly stating that weapons are prohibited. All University of Wisconsin system campuses and technical community college districts are said to be putting this signage in place. Legislation passed in Mississippi in 2011 creates an exception to allow concealed carry on college campuses for those who have taken a voluntary course on safe handling and use of firearms by a certified instructor.Recent court cases have also overturned some long-standing systemwide bans of concealed carry on state college and university campuses. In March 2012, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that the University of Colorado’s policy banning guns from campus violates the state’s concealed carry law, and in 2011 the Oregon Court of Appeals overturned the Oregon University System’s ban of guns on campuses, allowing those with permits to carry concealed guns on the grounds of these public colleges (Oregon's State Board of Higher Education retained its authority to have internal policies for certain areas of campus, and adopted a new policy in 2012 that bans guns in campus buildings). In both cases, it was ruled that state law dictates only the legislature can regulate the use, sale and possession of firearms, and therefore these systems had overstepped their authority in issuing the bans.  For up-to-date information on legislation, see the Education Bill Tracking Database.

Image credit: Theshibboleth and terrorist96 via Wikimedia CommonsIn July of this year, Georgia became the tenth state to prohibit public colleges and universities from banning concealed weapons on campus for permit holders. The controversy over campus carry legislation is a relatively small part of the national debate over gun rights and gun safety, but the recent Georgia decision is notable in that the governor used historical arguments in his initial rejection of a campus carry bill. Gun laws for college campuses vary widely throughout the United States, although all fifty states allow citizens who meet specific requirements to carry concealed weapons. The specific places where such weapons may be carried have been debated extensively. Those debates hinge on two seemingly contradictory notions. The notion employed by proponents of campus carry legislation is that allowing civilians to carry guns makes everybody safer. The notion employed by opponents of the legislation is that sensitive places exist in our society where guns are not appropriate in the hands of civilians. In his veto statement for the 2016 version of Georgia’s campus carry legislation, Governor Nathan Deal called college campuses “sanctuaries of learning” and quoted minutes from an 1824 meeting of the board of directors of the fledgling University of Virginia during which Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and their fellow directors stated that “No student shall, within the precincts of the University, introduce, keep or use any spirituous or venomous liquors, keep or use weapons or arms of any kind. . . ” Deal also referenced a 2008 Supreme Court case in which Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that “From Blackstone through the 19th century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” Justice Scalia further states that “nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on. . .laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places (emphasis mine) such as schools and government buildings. . .”So, what does it mean for a place to be “sensitive?” The 2016 campus carry bill included exceptions for specific places on campus including athletic events and student housing. Governor Deal noted that for him to reconsider the bill, further exceptions would have to be made including childcare facilities and faculty and staff offices. The compliance with these exceptions, and the addition of a provision banning guns in classrooms where high school students take classes, made it exceedingly difficult for Deal to veto the 2017 version of the bill. Yet, “sensitive” discussions happen every day in classrooms, commons, and cafeterias on campus. What is the value of distinguishing specific locations as being more or less “sensitive” when it comes to the explosive potential of firearms?A memorial on the drill field placed after the Virginia Tech massacre, April 21, 2007. Photo credit: Ross A. Cartrow via Wikimedia CommonsOn Monday, October 2, 2017, we all witnessed the aftermath of another deadly mass shooting, this time in Las Vegas. The victims were concert-goers, and the perpetrator was a man seemingly without a motive. No citizen with a gun would have been able to reach the man perched thirty-two storeys above his victims. The only security guard who may have tried to stop the shooter was killed an hour before the event transpired. Of the ten deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, two occurred at universities (Virginia Tech, 2007, and University of Texas, 1966) and one occurred at an elementary school (Sandy Hook, 2012). Each, in turn, has triggered a public debate about gun safety and gun control. At the heart of these debates is a larger question about who should have access to deadly force, and when and how such force can keep people safe. This question has been complicated by recent controversies over police shootings that disproportionately affect people of color, many unarmed. On the specific question of crime and safety on campus, mass shootings have seen precedents that support the notion of colleges and universities as places of heightened tensions. For example, the 1989 shooting of women engineering students at the  École Polytechnique in Montreal, and the 1991 shooting of students, professors, and administrators in the physics and astronomy department at the University of Iowa revealed ways in which university environments might lead certain people to violent actions. Were those actions preventable? And what role did access or lack of access to guns play in enabling perpetrators to shoot and victims to be shot? What has changed over the past thirty years that might lead to and/or justify the enactment of campus carry legislation?As public historians, our job is to uncover difficult histories and to bridge the gap between the past and the present through skilled interpretation. We do “sensitive” work every day. It seems increasingly clear to me that we must figure out how to bring difficult questions to light without allowing our work to be labeled or pigeonholed by one side or the other in an intractable political debate. Establishing and maintaining an effective social contract is challenging. We haven’t figured it out yet. Perhaps, as public historians, we can illuminate the reasoning of the people of the past, and we can encourage the people of the present to clarify their analogies. Perhaps we can help to light the way forward by pointing out the complexity of the past.~ Adina Langer is a public historian and educator based in Atlanta, Georgia.

It’s also a moment of change for other universities in the commonwealth.The Virginia Tech Innovation Campus will be the most visible sign of that shift, with a 1 million-square-foot campus in Alexandria expected to educate hundreds of graduate students. But an infusion of money and an anticipated increase in demand for technology education is expected to be felt at schools across Virginia.The pitch for Amazon’s headquarters included a statewide investment to double the annual number of graduates with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science and related fields, according to a Tuesday announcement by Gov. Ralph Northam (D). That commitment is expected to yield an additional 25,000 to 35,000 graduates over the next two decades.At George Mason University, an institute will be created to focus on digital innovation, and a new school of computing will be established. More than 5,000 students are enrolled in its computing programs, but with the Amazon decision the school expects the number of students seeking such degrees to triple.The commonwealth has committed up to $125 million over the next 20 years to expand George Mason’s Arlington campus with an emphasis on research and graduate education in technology, according to university officials. The school will match that figure.“This is a watershed moment that is going to really rebrand Greater Washington and Virginia as a hub of information technology,” George Mason President Ángel Cabrera said. “This puts us on the map in a really major way.”James E. Ryan, president of the University of Virginia, said in a statement Tuesday that U-Va. is looking forward to working with Amazon and other universities in Virginia. U-Va. has been expanding its programs in Northern Virginia over the past decade and plans to do even more.Sands said Virginia Tech had been working on the idea of an innovation campus for about four years, but a little over a year ago, state officials asked the university to lead a higher-education package that would be part of the region’s bid to Amazon. That accelerated the process — especially with a $250 million funding commitment from the commonwealth.Virginia Tech will match that, with the remaining cost of the campus covered by private donations, industry partnerships and other revenue streams.The Virginia Tech Innovation Campus will be focused on computer science and software engineering, with specializations in areas including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and data analytics.Next year, the first 100 students are expected to begin studying in a temporary space, but within five years, the university envisions 500 students on the campus. Ultimately, Virginia Tech expects to have 750 master’s degree candidates and hundreds of doctoral candidates and postdoctoral fellows enrolled.Sands said he expects a significant amount of money to be committed toward expanding enrollment in tech fields at many campuses in Virginia.“We’ll be scaling up significantly to meet the new challenge," he said.David J. Skorton, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and former president of Cornell University, compared the innovation campus to the Cornell Tech project he helped launch in New York. Cornell Tech "reinvented graduate tech education for the digital age and is further energizing the start-up culture in New York City,” he said. “I’m thrilled Virginia Tech’s leaders have stepped up to create a similar innovation hub.”Sheila Martin, vice president of economic development and community engagement for the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said she wasn’t surprised Amazon picked Northern Virginia and New York as the locations for new headquarters, because a company like Amazon is dependent on a high-skills workforce and the research that comes out of universities.“It’s a validation of the fact that universities are drivers of the growth and innovation in our economy,” she said. If the company were looking for the lowest-cost place to do business, it would have chosen other sites, she said, but it knows the workforce drives competitiveness and productivity and is willing to pay for that.Ana Mari Cauce, president of the University of Washington in Seattle, knows what it’s like to have a clutch of technology companies in the area, including Boeing, Microsoft and Amazon. They provide internships and job opportunities for students and graduates, help attract top faculty, and contribute to student scholarships, faculty chairs, research labs and new buildings. “We would not be the highly innovative university that we are without robust partnerships with the tech businesses in our area,” she wrote in an email Tuesday, "and they wouldn’t be as successful without their partnerships with us.”A tech boom can also bring challenges. “It’s also important to acknowledge that the rapid growth of these companies puts a strain on the housing market," Cauce wrote, “driving up rents and housing costs, and in Seattle, this has created real challenges to making affordable housing available, including for the people who teach and work at our public university.”Robert McCartney contributed to this report.

Get local news delivered to your inbox!Hokie Ambassador Zachary Kemp (right) leads prospective students and their families on a campus tour last year.Virginia Tech is offering some incoming students money to not attend the university for up to a year — a move that comes in the wake of an over-enrollment crunch.Tech’s over-sized freshman class, which is anticipated to have more than 7,000 students, would strain the infrastructure of the university and town of Blacksburg, officials have said.In an effort to ease that, Tech is offering a group of 1,559 incoming, in-state freshmen in specific programs financial incentives to skip the 2019-20 school year in Blacksburg — or at least a semester. The university has budgeted $3.3 million for the program.Incoming students will be able to apply for the following three options:Students have until June 6 to apply and will be notified if they’re accepted for the option they requested by June 14. They were informed of the options in an email sent Tuesday evening.“These special enrollment options... provide opportunities for getting an early start on college, taking advantage of alternative co-curricular learning experiences, and making the cost of a Virginia Tech education even more affordable,” the email said.The incoming freshmen are in-state students who have declared the following majors:Declining the options won’t impact a student’s admission status and the university will look forward to seeing them in the fall, the letter said.“We’re looking at multiple options for managing the over-enrollment,” Tech spokesman Mark Owczarski said. “We want to offer students things that work for them.”State Council of Higher Education for Virginia spokeswoman Laura Osberger wrote in an email that agency officials are “not aware of any Virginia institutions that have offered financial compensation” for students deferring admittance in the past.It is a first for Virginia Tech, Owczarski said. The university doesn’t have any goals or expectations for a number of students who will accept the offers, he said.After the university sees how many students accept, the school will “continue to make adjustments to our overall strategy,” he said.According to a consultant’s report obtained via the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, Tech’s goal was to have 6,600 first-year students in the fall.As of that May 3 report, 8,009 had confirmed they planned to come to the university. Tech contracted with the firm — Ruffalo, Noel and Levitz — to produce predictive models to help with enrollment management.The university anticipates there will be between 7,500 and 7,585 students when accounting for “summer melt” of students who go elsewhere. That would top a previous record set in 2017 of 6,836 students.The reason for the significant difference in the freshman class numbers, a Tech spokesman has said, is more students accepted than enrollment officials expected. That’s because a degree from the university is in high demand, Owczarski said.He said excitement around the university’s planned $1 billion Northern Virginia Innovation Campus, sparked by Amazon and announced last fall, is a likely catalyst.The university has rescinded the requirement for first year students to live on campus. The school’s standard occupancy is 9,471 beds with an additional 563 temporary beds available. The school is reviewing a way to add 200 additional beds.Last month, Tech President Tim Sands tweeted that though the university is attempting to grow, the goal isn’t to swell beyond 30,000 undergraduate students in the near future. Tech currently has 27,140 undergraduates, according to the university factbook.“Heard a rumor (again) today that VT will grow to the size of Penn St. or Ohio St. (46,000 undergrads),” Sands tweeted in April. “Truth: 2 yrs ago, we decided to cap undergrad enrollment at 30,000 until 2023 (<2% annual growth rate) until VT and Blacksburg infrastructure is in place. Will reassess then.”The university received more than 30,000 applications for next fall in what it said was the most diverse applicant pool in school history. The school said the arriving class of students will be the second-most academically competitive class based on GPA and SAT scores.Tech, though, used different metrics for this class. It was the first to be admitted using a uniform application process created by the Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success. University officials called it a more “holistic” approach that puts more weight on “non-cognitive attributes” and life experiences that come out in essays focused on resilience, leadership and service.For more information, incoming students can visit Virginia Tech’s website or contact admissions officials at enrolloptions@vt.edu or call the Virginia Tech Admissions office at 540-231-9797.Get local news delivered to your inbox!Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device.Please purchase a subscription to continue reading.

They were informed of the options in an email sent Tuesday evening.“These special enrollment options... provide opportunities for getting an early start on college, taking advantage of alternative co-curricular learning experiences, and making the cost of a Virginia Tech education even more affordable,” the email said.The incoming freshmen are in-state students who have declared the following majors:Declining the options won’t impact a student’s admission status and the university will look forward to seeing them in the fall, the letter said.“We’re looking at multiple options for managing the over-enrollment,” Tech spokesman Mark Owczarski said. “We want to offer students things that work for them.”State Council of Higher Education for Virginia spokeswoman Laura Osberger wrote in an email that agency officials are “not aware of any Virginia institutions that have offered financial compensation” for students deferring admittance in the past.It is a first for Virginia Tech, Owczarski said. The university doesn’t have any goals or expectations for a number of students who will accept the offers, he said.After the university sees how many students accept, the school will “continue to make adjustments to our overall strategy,” he said.According to a consultant’s report obtained via the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, Tech’s goal was to have 6,600 first-year students in the fall.As of that May 3 report, 8,009 had confirmed they planned to come to the university. Tech contracted with the firm — Ruffalo, Noel and Levitz — to produce predictive models to help with enrollment management.The university anticipates there will be between 7,500 and 7,585 students when accounting for “summer melt” of students who go elsewhere. That would top a previous record set in 2017 of 6,836 students.The reason for the significant difference in the freshman class numbers, a Tech spokesman has said, is more students accepted than enrollment officials expected. That’s because a degree from the university is in high demand, Owczarski said.He said excitement around the university’s planned $1 billion Northern Virginia Innovation Campus, sparked by Amazon and announced last fall, is a likely catalyst.The university has rescinded the requirement for first year students to live on campus. The school’s standard occupancy is 9,471 beds with an additional 563 temporary beds available. The school is reviewing a way to add 200 additional beds.Last month, Tech President Tim Sands tweeted that though the university is attempting to grow, the goal isn’t to swell beyond 30,000 undergraduate students in the near future. Tech currently has 27,140 undergraduates, according to the university factbook.“Heard a rumor (again) today that VT will grow to the size of Penn St. or Ohio St. (46,000 undergrads),” Sands tweeted in April. “Truth: 2 yrs ago, we decided to cap undergrad enrollment at 30,000 until 2023 (<2% annual growth rate) until VT and Blacksburg infrastructure is in place. Will reassess then.”The university received more than 30,000 applications for next fall in what it said was the most diverse applicant pool in school history. The school said the arriving class of students will be the second-most academically competitive class based on GPA and SAT scores.Tech, though, used different metrics for this class. It was the first to be admitted using a uniform application process created by the Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success. University officials called it a more “holistic” approach that puts more weight on “non-cognitive attributes” and life experiences that come out in essays focused on resilience, leadership and service.For more information, incoming students can visit Virginia Tech’s website or contact admissions officials at enrolloptions@vt.edu or call the Virginia Tech Admissions office at 540-231-9797.Get the day's top stories delivered to your inbox with our email newsletter.Robby Korth covers higher education, primarily at Virginia Tech.Forge a path to your future with Virginia Tech’s outstanding, world-leading colleges.

One of the first thoughts you might have after getting back your ACT or SAT score is how well you would have done on the other test. Luckily, SAT to ACT conversion (and ACT to SAT conversion) is possible!In this post, we provide conversion charts from the test makers themselves to help you with score conversions between both the current and old versions of the SAT and the ACT. We also look at whether certain colleges go easier on the SAT or ACT—and what you can do about it. We took the College Board's official concordance tables and made a tool for you to automatically convert your ACT scores into SAT scores.We've even included both current 1600 and old 2400 SAT conversions. Look at the latter if you took the ACT before 2016 and are curious about how your ACT score would have translated into an SAT score when originally you took the ACT.Just enter your ACT score on the left to get your SAT scores on the right:  Want to go in the other direction? Here are two tools to go from current 1600 SAT to ACT, or from old 2400 SAT to ACT.Note that the vast majority of high school students these days will have taken the 1600 SAT, but if you took the SAT before 2016 and are curious about how your scores would have converted to an ACT score (perhaps you're applying for an educational job or are casually comparing scores with friends), our conversion tool can lend you a hand.Want to improve your SAT score by 160 points or your ACT score by 4 points? We've written a guide for each test about the top 5 strategies you must be using to have a shot at improving your score. Download it for free now: ACT to SAT conversion can be extremely helpful for figuring out which test you're better at. It’s smartest to focus your efforts on just the SAT or ACT to maximize your score, rather than trying to score well on both tests. But if you take just one test, it’s useful to know how your score translates so you can better understand your performance as well as your chances of admission at various colleges.For example, by taking a practice test for both the SAT and ACT, you can figure out which test you're naturally better at. If you score dramatically higher on one test vs the other (say, the equivalent of 2 ACT points), you'll know to study for and take that test instead.As we explore below, ACT-SAT conversion doesn't always line up exactly at schools. Understanding what converting is and why it is not always even at certain schools can help you maximize your admission chances.Finally, be aware that converting composite scores won't give you the most accurate data. As a result, always convert your section scores, too.  The most accurate SAT-ACT concordance tables come directly from the makers of the SAT and ACT (the College Board and ACT, Inc., respectively). These are the only official conversion charts you can use to translate your ACT score into an SAT score (and vice versa). *Use this SAT score when a single score point comparison is neededSource: The College Board, 2018Note that this is the most up-to-date conversion and recommended by both the College Board and ACT, Inc. (as opposed to the 2016 initial concordance from the College Board); this chart is what schools will be using to compare SAT and ACT scores. For those of you who want to compare an ACT score with an old SAT score out of 2400, use the table below. Because the current version of the SAT has been in effect since 2016, most readers will want to use the conversion table above.In other words, only use the following table if you took the ACT or SAT before 2016 and want to know how your scores would have translated at the time you took the test.All estimates below are calculated using the above table and this SAT composite score conversion chart.  Which is easier, the ACT or the SAT? Find out with our detailed, comprehensive guide to figuring out which test is better for you. Now that we've learned about the SAT-ACT conversion tables made by the test makers themselves, you might think that if you look at admission statistics for various colleges, their SAT and ACT middle 50 percent ranges will match the official SAT-ACT conversions.Before we jump into this idea, though, what is the "middle 50 percent"? For a school, this phrase refers to the SAT/ACT score ranges for the middle 50 percent (or 25th to 75th percentile scores) of admitted students. For example, if a school has an ACT middle 50 percent range of 24 to 28, this means that 25% of admits had 24 or lower, 50% had between 24 and 28, and 25% had 28 or higher on the ACT.Schools report this data since it's a clear way to present the average test score ranges of admitted students. Reporting the full range of scores would be much less helpful as schools might have an admit or two with an extremely low test score, or a few admits with perfect scores. In other words, telling potential applicants that admitted students usually get ACT scores between 16 and 36 is not particularly helpful!So do these ranges for the ACT and SAT match up according to the conversions above? The truth is, at many colleges, the SAT and ACT middle 50 percent ranges don’t match up exactly. Thus, for some schools, you'd have to do slightly better on one test to be a competitive applicant.We'll go over a few example below. You can use this information as a guide when looking up the schools you're applying to.Notice as we go through these examples just how small the differences tend to be. We are not showing that you can game the system by taking the “easier” test for a certain school. As you'll see, the differences are quite small in most cases, but they can help you aim for the most competitive target score possible.  We'll start with a prominent East Coast school. NYU's middle 50 percent ranges are as follows:Using Table 1 to compare the scores, we see that ACT composite scores of 29-34 match up to SAT composite scores of 1330-1520. NYU’s actual SAT range is slightly lower than that, which means you'd need a comparatively higher ACT score to be within NYU’s 50 percent range. For a highly competitive East Coast example, let’s look at Princeton. This school has the following SAT and ACT middle 50 percent ranges:According to Table 1, these SAT scores match with an ACT score range of 32-36, which is very close to Princeton's actual ACT score range. At Princeton, then, there is not a slight ACT score advantage like there is at NYU. Here are Penn State’s middle 50 percent ranges:Table 1 shows that these ACT scores convert to an SAT range of 1200-1380. In this case, you'd need to score slightly lower on the ACT than you would on the SAT to be in Penn State's middle 50 percent. Now for a West Coast example. Here are the the University of Washington’s score ranges:According to Table 1, UW's SAT range would match up with 25-33 ACT composite. However, its actual ACT range is slightly higher at 27-32.This means you could get a comparatively lower SAT score of 1200 and be within range at UW. But if you had the matching ACT score of 24, you'd be a little less competitive. Another West Coast example is USC. Here are USC's middle 50 percent ranges for the SAT and ACT:By converting these ACT scores into SAT scores using Table 1, we get an SAT score range of 1360-1520. As we suspected, this suggests that your ACT score needs to be slightly higher than your SAT score does to be competitive at USC. So what can we take from all of this? There are definitely some slight but noticeable differences in certain colleges’ SAT and ACT middle 50 percent ranges compared with the expected conversions. However, there are plenty of exceptions as well.Here's the thing: even in schools that seem to go slightly easier on one test, the differences are nominal. This means that it doesn't make sense to base your testing strategy entirely on whether a school appears to go easier on ACT or SAT scores. Instead, it’s much smarter to focus on the test you can do better on to maximize your score.In our test cases above, ACT and SAT ranges did not deviate from expected values by more than 10 -40 SAT points or 1-2 ACT composite points. These are minor score differences you can easily overcome with smart studying, especially if you're taking the test better suited to your strengths.For example, say you're a better SAT taker, but you notice that some Ivy League schools go a bit easier on ACT scores. If you took the ACT and got a 30 when you were capable of scoring between 1450 and 1550 on the SAT, you'd decrease your chance of getting in. In the end, there is no substitute for smart studying. But it's still useful to look up the middle 50 percent test score ranges for your target schools. You can even use the conversion charts like we did to see if the school favors one test. Then, use this info to form your own target score.For example, if you’re applying to a school that goes a bit easier on the ACT, aim for an ACT score in the upper end of their middle 50 range to ensure that, even with ACT-SAT conversion, you are still well within their typical ranges.Remember, the bottom line in college admissions is to play up your strengths. Maximizing your ACT or SAT score is by far the best advantage you can give yourself on the standardized testing front! Sure, we’ve argued that colleges don’t give a huge advantage to either the SAT or ACT, but is one test easier than the other? Find out whether the SAT or ACT is easier. Also, check out the 11 key differences between the two tests to help you decide which one to take.If you already know which test you're taking, use our SAT or ACT goal score guide to develop a target score based on the schools you're applying to.Curious about what it takes to get a perfect SAT or ACT score?

Unlike apples and oranges, it is possible to compare the ACT and SAT – though it can be a little bit complicated. One of the first thoughts you might have after getting your ACT or SAT score back is how well you would have done on the other test. Luckily, SAT to ACT conversion (and ACT to SAT conversion) is possible.In this post, we'll provide conversion charts from the test makers themselves to help you with score conversions between both the new and old versions of the SAT and the ACT. We'll also learn if certain colleges go easier on either the SAT or ACT – and what you can do about it. We took the College Board's official concordance tables and made a tool for you to automatically convert your ACT to SAT scores. We've even included both new SAT and old SAT conversions.Just enter your ACT on the LEFT, and get your SAT scores on the right:Want to go in the other direction? Here are two tools to go from New 1600 SAT to ACT, or from Old 2400 SAT to ACT.  Want to improve your SAT score by 160 points or your ACT score by 4 points? We've written a guide for each test about the top 5 strategies you must be using to have a shot at improving your score.

 ACT to SAT conversion can be very helpful to figure out which test you're better at. It’s smartest to focus your efforts on just the SAT or the ACT to maximize your score, rather than trying to score well on both tests. But if you take just one test, it’s useful to know how your score would translate to better understand your performance and chances at certain colleges.For example, if you take a practice test for each exam, you want to figure out which test you're naturally better at. If you score dramatically higher on one test vs the other (say, the equivalent of 2 ACT points), you might do better to study that test instead.Furthermore, as we explore below, ACT-SAT conversion might not line up exactly at certain schools. Understanding what converting is and why it is not always even at certain schools can help you maximize your admission chances. The most accurate concordance tables come directly from the makers of the test – College Board. These are the most up to date tables officially released.  Via College Board.Note that this conversion chart comes from the College Board only. The ACT has commented that this table has not yet been verified by the ACT, and that the two organizations need to collaborate to create a more accurate conversion table. In my opinion, this table is likely to be pretty close in accuracy, and you can use it for your planning purposes for now. For those of you who want to compare an ACT score with the "old" SAT, which was scored between 600 and 2400, you can use the table below.Via the ACT Website. This table is appropriate to use if you have an old SAT score and want to compare it with the ACT. This table was originally developed to be a more simple comparison between the old SAT and the ACT, rather than the double-table method shown above. In fact, the ACT argued that this table was better than the double-table method, since it's easier to use and doesn't count the ACT English section twice. So if you have an old SAT score, you can use either this table or the double-table above to convert your score, but you'll probably find Table 2 to be more convenient.This table may also continue to be relevant for a few years as colleges continue to use SAT score ranges based on the old 2400 SAT. (We won't have any data about average SAT scores at colleges based on the Redesigned SAT until the end of the 2016-17 college admissions cycle, so we will have to continue referencing the 2400 SAT for a while.) Since we are currently in a transition period between the old SAT and redesigned SAT, if you are translating an ACT score to an SAT score, it may be useful to get both an estimated Old SAT Score (out of 2400) and Redesigned SAT score (out of 1600). To compare both methods we can take an example.(If you are translating the other way, from an SAT score to an ACT score, you can simply use the table that's appropriate for the type of score you have: Table 1 if you took the Redesigned SAT, and Table 2 if you took the Old SAT.)Say you have an ACT composite of 30 and want to know what your score would have been on the SAT. Using Table 1, an ACT composite of 30 would convert to an SAT score of 1330-1350, with 1340 offered as a single score estimate. Using Table 2, the ACT composite score of 30 would translate to an SAT score of between 1980-2010, or 2000 as a single estimate.So our final conversions are as follows:Table 1 (Redesigned SAT)Table 2 (Old SAT)ACT Score30 30SAT Score Conversion1330-1350 (1340)1980-2010 (2000) Why is it useful to have these two score conversions? If you're looking up admissions data at different college websites, you may find that many of them still have old SAT data. So if colleges are posting score ranges based on the old 2400 scale, you will need to know how your ACT composite translates to the old SAT composite to get a sense of how competitive it is.That said, even before the SAT switched to the Redesigned version, many colleges just posted a 1600 SAT composite anyway: a combination of the Reading and Math sections. In that case, having a translation to the Redesigned SAT, out of 1600, could be useful too.So to get the most out of your research, if you're translating an ACT score to an SAT score, make sure to find out what your Old SAT score and your Redesigned SAT score would have been. Which is easier, the ACT or the SAT? Find out with our detailed, comprehensive guide to figuring out which test is better for you. So now that we've learned about the SAT-ACT conversion tables made by the test makers themselves, you might think that if you look at admission statistics for various colleges, their SAT and ACT middle 50 percent ranges will match up to the official SAT-ACT conversions.What are the middle 50 percent ranges? The middle 50 percent ranges are the score ranges for the middle 50 percent of their admitted students, or their 25th-75th percentile score ranges. So, for example, if a school has an ACT middle 50 percent range of 24 to 28, that means that 25% of their admits had a 24 and lower, 50% of their admits had between a 24 and a 28, and 25% of their admits had a 28 or higher on the ACT. Schools report these ranges since they are a clear way to show the average test score ranges that admitted students have. Reporting the full range of scores would be much less helpful, since schools might have an admit or two with a very low ACT score and a few admits with perfect ACT scores. Telling potential applicants that their admitted students have ACT scores between 16 and 36 is not very helpful!In fact, at many colleges, the SAT and ACT middle 50 percent ranges don’t match up exactly.This means for some schools, you would have to do slightly better on one test to be a competitive applicant. As a very rough rule of thumb, you need a slightly higher SAT score to stay competitive at East Coast schools and a slightly higher ACT score to be competitive at West Coast schools. This is because the ACT is still the most widely taken test on the West Coast, and the SAT is more popular on the East Coast. The more students who take the test, the higher your score has to be to stand out.However, this is not a hard and fast rule. We will go over a few examples, and exceptions, below. Use this as a guide for looking up the schools you are applying to.Notice as we go through these examples how small the differences tend to be. We are not showing that you can game the system by taking the “easier” test for a certain school. As we’ll see, the differences are quite small in most cases, but they can help you aim for the most competitive target score possible.  We will start with a prominent East Coast school. NYU's middle 50 percent ranges are as follows:Using Table 2 to compare the scores (since this is data from the Old SAT), ACT composite scores of 28-32 would match up to SAT composite scores of 1880-2120. NYU’s SAT ranges are slightly higher than that, which means you need a comparatively higher SAT than ACT score to be within NYU’s 50 percent ranges. For a very competitive East Coast example, let’s look at Princeton. They have an SAT Composite middle 50 percent range of 2120 to 2390. Using Table 2 to convert, those SAT scores would match with an ACT range of between 32 and 36. However, Princeton’s actual ACT range is between 31 and 35!This means that if you have an ACT score of 31, you would be within Princeton’s middle 50 percent score ranges, but if you had the equivalent SAT score of 2060, your score would be lower than their ranges and put you at a disadvantage. Being an East Coast school does not always mean the SAT is more competitive. To take an example, Penn State’s middle 50 percent ranges are 26-30 for ACT and 1750-2000 for SAT. Using Table 2 to convert, those ACT scores would convert to an SAT range of 1770-2000, which is almost exactly what Penn State's real SAT middle 50 percent ranges are. So for Penn State, there is not a slight ACT score advantage like there is at NYU and Princeton. Now for a West Coast example. The University of Washington’s SAT range is 1570-2020, which would match up with about an 23-31 ACT Composite using Table 2. However, their actual ACT range is 25-31.This means you could get a comparatively lower SAT score of 1570 and be within range at the University of Washington, but if you had the matching ACT score of 23, you would be slightly less competitive, even though the difference between 23 and 25 is fairly substantial. USC's middle 50 percent ranges for the SAT are 1920-2230, and for the ACT they are 29 to 33. If we converted those ACT ranges using Table 2, we would get an SAT score range of 1940-2180. This actually suggests your SAT score needs to be higher for USC!  So USC doesn’t quite fit the West Coast stereotype of requiring higher ACT scores to be competitive. So what can we take from all of this? There are definitely some slight but noticeable differences in some colleges’ SAT and ACT middle 50 percent ranges compared to the expected conversions, but plenty of exceptions as well.Here's the thing: even in schools that seem to go slightly easier on one test, the differences are small. This means it doesn't make sense to base your testing strategy entirely on whether a school seems to go easier on ACT or SAT scores. It’s much smarter to focus on the test you can do better on to maximize your score. In our test cases above, ACT and SAT ranges did not deviate from expected values more than 20 or 30 SAT points or 1 to 2 ACT composite points. These are score differences you can easily overcome with smart studying, especially if you are taking the test you are better suited to.To take an example, say you are a better SAT-taker, but you notice that some Ivy League schools seem to go a bit easier on ACT scores. If you were to take the ACT and get a 30, when you were capable of scoring between 2200-2300 on the SAT, you would decrease your chances of getting in.  In the end, there is no substitute for smart studying. But it is still useful to look up the middle 50 percent test score ranges for your target schools. You can even use the conversion charts like we did to see if the school “favors” one test or another slightly. Then, use this info to form your own target score. For example, if you’re applying to a school that goes a bit easier on the ACT, aim for an ACT score in the upper end of their middle 50 range to ensure that, even with ACT-SAT conversion, you are still well within their typical ranges.   Remember, the bottom line in college admissions is playing up your strengths. That means maximizing your ACT or SAT score is the best advantage you can give yourself on the standardized testing front. Sure, we’ve argued that colleges don’t give a huge advantage to either the SAT or ACT, but is one test easier than the other?

Early decision has its own critics who argue, along similar lines, that the practice gives implicit preference to applicants who can afford to commit to an institution before knowing their financial aid package.“The previous expectation in the early decision plan that students lock in their commitment to Virginia Tech well before the regular decision deadline was not a good option for all of our applicants, particularly those needing financial aid, and created unneeded pressure on students,” Juan Espinoza, associate vice provost for enrollment management, wrote in the university’s statement.The university will still offer the early-action option for applicants, however, which is nonbinding.A new report says a 5 percent increase in low-income students admitted would result in more socioeconomic diversity aSubscribe for free to Inside Higher Ed’s newsletters, featuring the latest news, opinion and great new careers in higher education — delivered to your inbox.View NewslettersCopyright © 2023 Inside Higher Ed All rights reserved. | Website designed by nclud
